We strongly believe that building a social infrastructure through a welcoming, engaged and diverse community is key for sharing knowledge and supporting others for adoption of a new culture.\nBenefits\nThere may be several benefits from either following us or engaging and promoting OPP:\nLearn about open science/education and reproducible research in the context of plant pathology\nMeet new colleagues (who can become your future collaborators) by joining our Slack workspace who can help you out with any question\nAcademic and scientific exchange via freely available Virtual Seminars on our YouTube channel\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOpenPlantPathology is a not for-profit initiative founded in January 2018 by Emerson Del Ponte and Adam Sparks to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant pathology. Of course, this would not be possible without the support from several colleagues who helped spread the initiative and the culture of open science. Currently, our team is composed of the following leaders.\nAdam Sparks\nFounder. Webmaster\nSenior Research Scientist, Bioeconomic Modeller\nDepartment of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), Western Australia, Australia\nEmerson Del Ponte\nFounder.
