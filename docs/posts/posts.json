    "contents": "\nBackground\nTraineR2 is an enhancement of TraineR (see context here), sharing the same goal - facilitating the training of plant pathologists in estimating plant disease severity. The primary distinction lies in TraineR2’s utilization of actual photographs of disease symptoms, offering a more authentic representation compared to the computer-generated imagery used in TraineR. Additionally, the duration of the training session in TraineR2 is determined by the number of images available in the collection, presenting another noteworthy difference.\nWhat is this app for?\nThe objective of TraineR is to enhance the accuracy of prospective raters in estimating disease severity, based on the perceived percentage of the diseased area. At present, the app houses images of six plant diseases: Apple Glomerella leaf spot, citrus canker, eucalyptus Calonectria blight, gerbera Botrytis leaf blight, pecan scab, soybean rust, peanut leaf spot, and peach leaf rust. These images have been generously provided by colleagues in the plant pathology community and have been utilized in scientific papers for the validation of standard area diagram sets (SADs).\nHow was it developed?\nThe app was developed in R + Shiny and was made available at the shinyapps.io pages.\nFuture plans\nThis project is open to contributions of images from the community. Anyone interested in contributing should reach out to the app developer.\nProject website: https://delponte.shinyapps.io/traineR2/Author and maintainer: Emerson M. Del Ponte\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBackground\nTraining session for the assessment of disease severity has been used in the past and proven useful to improve rater’s precision and accuracy when visually quantifying disease severity - a variable that is relatively more difficult to assess given the subjectivity of the task (Bock et al. 2022b). In those sessions, raters are exposed to a series of computerized diagrams or actual images of plant organs displaying disease symptoms, all with known severity. For each image, raters need to provide their best estimate based on the perceived percent diseased area of the organ. After each rated image, the actual value is displayed and that is when the training begins!\nResearch on this topic began during the mid-1980s with the arrival of personal computers, which were used to develop computerized images of specific and measured disease severity. Those software, running on DOS or Windows system, included AREAGRAM, DISTRAIN, DISEASE.PRO, ESTIMATE, and SEVERITY.PRO (See review by Bock et al. (2022a)).\nWhat is this app for?\nThe goal of TraineR is to allow users to generate computerized ellipsoidal images that resemble a plant organ (eg. leaf, fruit) and lesions of varying number, shape and color. Then, users should look at the generated standard area diagram and mentally provide an estimate of disease severity based on the perceived diseased area in percentage. When clicking on show % severity, the app calculates the actual disease severity as the percentage of the leaf area covered by the lesions.\nHow was it developed?\nThe app was developed in R + Shiny and was made available at the shinyapps.io pages.\nWhat is next?\nThe app has currently some limitations such as no lesion overlapping and maximum severity of around 60%. It is also limited to generate ellipsoidal shapes. Future efforts could focus on the generation of organs and lesions of different shape such as polygonal. It could also be optimized to record the assessments and calculate the accuracy of the estimates based on a certain number of assessment. There are no current plans for implementing these features.\nProject website: https://edelponte.shinyapps.io/traineR/Author and maintainer: Emerson M. Del Ponte\n\n\n\nBock, C.

    "contents": "\nWe (Emerson Del Ponte and Adam Sparks) started this initiative (Open Plant Pathology) in early January 2018 with the idea that we would create a community in which plant pathologists could come together and share resources and ideas and encourage a freer exchange of information, code and data.\nOne of the reasons for this was that a few years before that, we’d started working on analysis of randomly selected plant pathology papers, initially we looked at 300 published from 2012 until 2018, but it later grew to encompass 450 papers published from 2012 until 2021, with Kaique Alves, Zachary Foster and Nik Grünwald, which was published in Phytopathology® in January (Sparks et al. 2023b).\nWhat we were finding as we looked at papers across 21 journals that were dedicated to plant pathology research or published specialised sections or articles in the field of plant pathology was not surprising, but still disappointing.\nAs a discipline, we simply do not make much, if any, effort to help ensure that others can easily reproduce our work after it is published (Sparks et al. 2023b).\nWe found that most articles were not reproducible according to our scoring system and failed to take advantage of open science and reproduciblity methods that would benefit both the authors and the readers.\nTo wit, the vast majority of articles we looked at made no attempt to share code or data, scoring “0” in our system (Figure 1).\n\n\nlibrary(Reproducibility.in.Plant.Pathology)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nrrpp <- import_notes()\n\na <- ggplot(rrpp, aes(x = as.factor(comp_mthds_avail))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"black\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Article Score\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Code\")\n\nb <- ggplot(rrpp, aes(x = as.factor(data_avail))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"black\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Article Score\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Data\")\n\np <- a + b\np <- p +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") &\n  theme_light()\n\np\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Aggregated article scores for each of the two categories evaluated, (A) displays ‘Code availability’, where ‘0’ was ‘Not available or not mentioned in the publication’; ‘1’ was ‘Available upon request to the author; ’2’ was ‘Online, but inconvenient or non-permanent (e.g., login needed, paywall, FTP server, personal lab website that may disappear, or may have already disappeared)’; and ‘3’ was ‘Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future (e.g., archived using Zenodo, dataverse or university library or some other proper archiving system)’; ‘NA’ indicates that no code was created to conduct the work that was detectable. (B) shows ‘Data availability’, where ‘0’ was ‘Not available or not mentioned in the publication’; ‘1’ was ‘Available upon request to the author; ’2’ was ‘Online, but inconvenient or non-permanent (e.g., login needed, paywall, FTP server, personal lab website that may disappear, or may have already disappeared)’; and ‘3’ was ‘Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future (e.g., archived using Zenodo, dataverse or university library or some other proper archiving system)’; ‘NA’ indicates that no data were generated, e.g., a methods paper. Figure reproduced from (Sparks et al. 2023b) under a Creative Commons Licence using code found in (Sparks et al. 2023a).\n\n\n\nThat’s a pretty shocking, but unsurprising figure.\nWe get it.\nIt’s just one (or more) things that you have to do when you’re prepping that paper for submission.\nWe mean, why bother ensuring that your code and data are available.\nThe paper describes everything and if anyone has any questions they can just contact you, right?\nExcept it isn’t that easy.\nAt least not for the readers.\nA 2018 study by -Stodden et al. (2018) found that from\n\n“a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26%. We find this policy—author remission of data and code postpublication upon request—an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.”\n\nThe whole article is available from PNAS and it’s well worth a read if you’re at all interested, which we assume that you are if you’re reading this blog post.\nBut going farther, Tedersoo et al. (2021) published “Data sharing practices and data availability upon request differ across scientific disciplines” saying, “We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals.”\nWe, personally, know this too well having tried and failed to get additional data missing from papers to reproduce work or models that we were interested in and authors didn’t respond or if they did, were dismissive and didn’t or weren’t able to provide what we was looking for.\nIn fact, it seems that it’s not that we don’t want to or intend to or at least “we say that we want to but then we don’t” (Watson 2022).\nBut looking at Figure 1, it looks like we don’t even mention the data or code being available (a score of “1”) for the most part either in plant pathology.\nSo what is it then?\nJust no time?\nLack of know-how?\nWe just don’t care?\nOr maybe, we haven’t been provided with enough training to use the tools and enough information to realise how beneficial it really is.\nThere are some examples in the community though, Open Wheat Blast is a great example of what can be achieved when scientists collaborate openly.\nNow that we’ve quantified the problem, we would like to see more of these and we’re here to help.\nFeel free to contact any of us directly or through Mastodon, Twitter, Slack (an open invite) or GitHub, we’re here to help, after all, it’s our mission.\nColophon\nThis post was constructed using R Version 4.2.2 (R Core Team 2022).\n\n─ Session info

Routinely\nrust infections are managed through the effective use of genetic\nresistance, an innate ability in plants to resist pests and pathogens.\nWhile the modern wheat cultivars are prone to attack by the recently\nevolved rust strains, the historical collection of domesticated wheat\nand its wild relatives are resilient due to enriched genetic diversity.\nWe mapped, identified, and characterised a few rust resistance genes\nfrom wheat and its progenitor and wild relatives through map-based\ncloning. However, due to the large and complex nature of the wheat\ngenome, this conventional process is tedious and time-consuming. But\nwith the near-complete sequencing of the wheat genome and advancements\nin DNA capture and sequencing, we have developed robust strategies to\naccelerate resistance gene cloning. Further, through gene cassette\ntechnology, we combined and introduced multiple and diverse rust\nresistance genes in a common wheat cultivar. In parallel, we have made\nprogress in accelerating rust pathogen surveillance through effective\nintegration of DNA sequencing techniques that will ensure precise\nselection of resistance genes to protect wheat from the newly emerged\nrust strains.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nPreviously we introduced Julia, a programming language that is similar to R or Python and demonstrated how AUDPC can be calculated using the trapezoidal method in R as shown in the “Disease Progress Over Time” module of the “Epidemiology and Ecology in R,” Sparks et al. (2008). Then we looked at how the function could be optimised in R before writing a Julia function to calculate the same value.\nNow we will take a look at a similar calculation, Area Under the Disease Stairs (AUDPS) (Simko and Piepho 2012). AUDPS can give better estimates of the disease progress by giving a weight closer to the optimal first and last observations.\nThis function is not the fully optimised version like what we showed for AUDPC, using sum() would help make this faster but possibly at the expense of readability so we’ll stick with using the regular + and - here for readability.\n\n\nr_audps <-\n  function(evaluation, dates) {\n    n <- length(dates)\n    n_1 <- length(dates) - 1\n    \n    x <- 0\n    for (i in seq_len(n_1)) {\n      x <- x + evaluation[[i]] * (dates[[i + 1]] - dates[[i]])\n    }\n    audps <- x + evaluation[[n]] * (dates[[n]] - dates[[n_1]])\n    return(audps)\n  }\n\n\n\nBoth of the R packages that were previously discussed when showing how to calculate AUDPC, agricolae (Mendiburu 2021) and epifitter (Alves and Del Ponte 2021), provide easy to use functions to calculate AUDPS, audps() and AUDPS(), respectively. The following code uses an example from agricolae’s help showing how to calculate AUDPS in R using our own function, r_audps().\n> dates <- c(14, 21, 28) # days\n> evaluation <- c(40, 80, 90)\n> r_audps(evaluation, dates)\n\n[1] 14 21 28\n[1] 40 80 90\n[1] 1470\n\nUsing Julia\nSince we’ve already introduced Julia, here we’ll just build an AUDPS function in Julia to illustrate how it can be done.\n\nfunction j_audps(evaluation, dates)\n    \n    # find how many observations there are and calculate that minus 1 as well\n    n = length(dates)\n    n_1 = length(dates) - 1\n\n    # initialise our objects outside the loop\n    i = 0\n    out = 0\n    # the for loop looks roughly the same but here we just use 1:n\n    for j in 1:n_1\n        i = i + evaluation[j] * (dates[j + 1] - dates[j])\n        \n        out = i + evaluation[n] * (dates[n] - dates[n_1])\n    end\n  \n    # return the object, `out` from the for loop\n    return out\n\n# end the function (no curly brackets!)\nend\nj_audps (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> dates = [14, 21, 28] # days\njulia> evaulation = [40, 80, 90]\njulia> j_audps(evaulation, dates)\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 14\n 21\n 28\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 40\n 80\n 90\n1470\n\nThe AUDPS values match!\nConclusion\nThis is just a quick follow-up example of how you can use Julia in plant pathology to show new users how it compares with R with a another commonly used function. If you’re curious to know more, the Julia docs are a great place to start. In particular, the noteworthy differences is a useful bit to refer to if you’re familiar with R.\nFor a more detailed comparison of complete Julia and R packages that offer an existing plant disease model, EPIRICE (Savary et al. 2012), see Epicrop.jl (Sparks 2022), a port of epicrop (Sparks et al. 2021) to Julia, which has demonstrated faster speeds in benchmarking tests for the same rice disease predictions.\nColophon\nThis post was constructed using R Version 4.1.2 (R Core Team 2021) and Julia Version 1.7.1 (Bezanson et al. 2017) using JuliaCall Pull Request #174.\n\n\n\nAlves, K. dos S., and Del Ponte, E.

    "contents": "\n\nWikipedia describes Julia by saying, it “is a is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.”1 In short, it can be scripted like R, which many of us are likely to be more familiar with. But provides efficiency gains, being much faster than R to execute code2. While this may not matter much in day-to-day work for you, if you have a large set of data to work with, e.g., large geographic or temporal sets of data covering country or global areas for many years, Julia may be useful to you in performing the analysis. Alternatively, maybe you’re just curious and want to try something new. Even though it’s not as mature, Julia does have some features that R does not like multiple dispatch, which may be of interest to more advanced users.\nTo introduce you to Julia, I will demonstrate how to calculate area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) (Shaner and Finney 1977) in R and then in Julia.\nInstallation\nIf you’ve ever installed R then you’ll be able to install and use Julia as well. Simply head over to https://julialang.org/downloads/ and download the proper version for your computer’s OS and processor. Then follow the directions from https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/ to install it for your platform.\nCalculating AUDPC\nUsing R\nIn the “Disease Progress Over Time” module of the “Epidemiology and Ecology in R,” Sparks et al. (2008) demonstrate how to write an R function to calculate AUDPC as follows.\n# Build a function for AUDPC calculation\n# the left curly bracket indicates the beginning\n# of the function\naudpc <- function(disease.severity, time.period) {\n  #n is the length of time.period, or\n  #  the total number of sample dates\n  n <- length(time.period)\n  \n  # meanvec is the vector (matrix with one dimension)\n  # that will contain the mean percent infection\n  # it is initialized containing -1 for all entries\n  # this sort of initialization is sometimes useful\n  # for debugging\n  meanvec <- matrix(-1, (n - 1))\n  \n  # intvec is the vector that will contain the length of\n  # time between sampling dates\n  intvec <- matrix(-1, (n - 1))\n  \n  # the loop goes from the first to the penultimate entry\n  # the left curly bracket indicates the beginning of\n  # commands in the loop\n  for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {\n    #the ith entry in meanvec is replaced with the\n    #   mean percent infection\n    #between sample time i and sample time i+1\n    meanvec[i] <- mean(c(disease.severity[i],\n                         disease.severity[i + 1]))\n    \n    #the ith entry in intvec is replaced with the length\n    # of the time interval between time i and time i+1\n    intvec[i] <- time.period[i + 1] - time.period[i]\n    \n    #the right curly bracket ends the loop\n  }\n  \n  # the two vectors are multiplied together\n  # one entry at a time\n  infprod <- meanvec * intvec\n  \n  # the sum of the entries in the resulting vector\n  # gives the AUDPC\n  sum(infprod)\n  \n  #the right curly bracket ends the function\n}\nThis function in R can be improved for efficiency as follows.\n\n\nr_audpc <- function(disease.severity, time.period) {\n  # only calculate n-1 once\n  n <- length(time.period) - 1\n  \n  # set up vectors, not matrices, as double precision to contain the mean\n  # percent infection (meanvec) and difference between obs times (intvec)\n  meanvec <- vector(mode = \"double\", length = n)\n  intvec <- vector(mode = \"double\", length = n)\n  \n  # using `seq_len()` is safer than 1:n, if n = 0\n  for (i in seq_len(n)) {\n    \n    # double brackets for assigning values in a vector are preferred\n    # using `sum()` in place of `+` for `i + 1` is faster\n    meanvec[[i]] <-\n      mean(c(disease.severity[[i]], disease.severity[[sum(i, 1)]]))\n    intvec[[i]] <- time.period[sum(i, 1)] - time.period[[i]]\n  }\n  \n  # save a step and put everything on one line, returning the AUDPC value\n  return(sum(meanvec * intvec))\n}\n\n\n\nOr, if you prefer, you can install libraries from CRAN that provide functions for calculating AUDPC rather than writing your own. The R packages agricolae (de Mendiburu 2021) and epifitter (Alves and Del Ponte 2021) provide easy to use functions to calculate AUDPC, audpc() and AUDPC(), respectively. The following code an example from agricolae’s help showing how to calculate AUDPC in R using our own function, r_audpc().\n> dates <- c(14, 21, 28) # days\n> evaluation <- c(40, 80, 90)\n> r_audpc(evaluation, dates)\n\n[1] 14 21 28\n[1] 40 80 90\n[1] 1015\n\nUsing Julia\nCurrently I’m unaware of any packages for Julia offering this functionality. However, we can easily duplicate r_audpc() from R to Julia but need to make a few minor changes for differences in the languages. Most of the following function should look familiar. The first thing is that we cannot have a . in the function argument names, so we’ll just use a single word here for clarity. The second is that we cannot use <- for assigning values as in R. We must use = to assign in Julia, however you can use = in R as well if you wish. Functions are written in roughly the same manner as in R and they are called in the same way, fn_name(arg1, arg2, ...).\n\nfunction j_audpc(evaluation, dates)\n    \n    n = length(evaluation) - 1\n    \n    # again we preallocate vectors to hold the values but also create a third\n    # object, out, since it will be inside our for loop unlike in R\n    meanvec = Base.zeros(n)\n    intvec = Base.zeros(n)\n    out = 0.0\n\n    # the for loop looks roughly the same but here we just use 1:n\n    for i in 1:n\n        # rather than using a mean() we just divide by 2 here\n        meanvec[i] = (evaluation[i] + evaluation[i + 1]) / 2\n        \n        # this is the same\n        intvec[i] = dates[i + 1] - dates[i]\n        \n        # here we sum the values in the loop as Julia will compile this and it\n        # will run more quickly. In R this is undesireable behaviour so we\n        # performed this outside of the loop.\n        \n        # also note here that before the `*` we have a `.`, this means to\n        # \"broadcast\" across the vector. In R this automatically happens, in\n        # Julia to perform operations to all values in a vector you must\n        # broadcast\n        out = sum(meanvec .* intvec)\n    end\n  \n    # return the object, `out` from the for loop\n    return out\n\n# end the function (no curly brackets!)\nend\nj_audpc (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> dates = [14, 21, 28] # days\njulia> evaulation = [40, 80, 90]\njulia> j_audpc(evaulation, dates)\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 14\n 21\n 28\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 40\n 80\n 90\n1015.0\n\nThe AUDPC values match!\nConclusion\nThis is just a quick example of how you can use Julia in plant pathology to show new users how it compares with R with a commonly used function. If you’re curious to know more, the Julia docs are a great place to start. In particular, the noteworthy differences is a useful bit to refer to if you’re familiar with R.\nFor a more detailed comparison of complete Julia and R packages that offer an existing plant disease model, EPIRICE (Savary et al. 2012), see Epicrop.jl (Sparks 2022), a port of epicrop (Sparks et al. 2021) to Julia, which has demonstrated faster speeds in benchmarking tests for the same rice disease predictions.\nColophon\nThis post was constructed using R Version 4.1.2 (R Core Team 2021) and Julia Version 1.7.1 (Bezanson et al. 2017) using JuliaCall Pull Request #174.\n\n\n\nAlves, K. dos S., and Del Ponte, E.

In 2018, Anne returned to The University of Queensland to work with Prof Bernie Carroll, an expert in RNA interference in plants, and Prof Neena Mitter, Director of the Centre for Horticultural Science at the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, on gene silencing in plants and fungi. Under their mentorship she gained immense experience of RNA interference, which led to being awarded an Advance Queensland Industry Research Fellowship to develop RNA vaccines against fungal diseases threatening Queensland crops and native plants. Anne is now working closely with partners at the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Nufarm Australia, Tropical Pines, Howe Farming Enterprises and New England BioLabs to translate her research into a technology that can be used by Australian farmers as an alternative to broad-spectrum pesticides.\nAbstract\nRNA interference (RNAi) vaccines are an emerging environmentally-friendly crop protection platform that are effective against agricultural pests and pathogens. The approach involves applying pathogen-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to the host plant to trigger RNAi and silence targeted pathogen genes, inactivating the pathogen and protecting the plant. When applied as BioClay™, in combination with clay particles that bind dsRNA, RNAi vaccines can provide plants with protection for more than 20 days, making a single spray a commercially feasible and lasting approach to protect crops. We have been exploring RNAi vaccines as a novel control for Phytophthora root rot and myrtle rust, two aggressive diseases which are destroying natural plant populations across Australia and causing significant economic losses to horticulture, forestry and native plant industries. We have synthesised dsRNA targeting essential Phytophthora cinnamomi and Austropuccinia psidii genes which have fungicidal activity against the respective pathogens in vitro and in planta and are now investigating the mechanism of RNAi vaccine-induced protection. Our ultimate goal is to develop a clean green safe control strategy for these invasive diseases to safeguard Australian horticulture, forestry and native plant industries, with long-term benefits for conservation and biodiversity.\n\n\n\n",

His PhD research under the supervision of Assoc. Prof Femi Akinsanmi and Prof Vic Galea, investigates the aetiology and epidemiology of the flower blight diseases of macadamia. Prasannath has so far published four research articles from his PhD.\nAbstract\nRaceme blights also known as flower blights are used to describe diseases and disorders of macadamia inflorescence worldwide. Flower blights reduce fruit set and control measures are limited.\nKnowledge of the disease cycle and epidemiological parameters is required. Therefore, the potential sources of inoculum for the three forms of flower blights of macadamia in Australia were investigated. Relative abundance of the inoculum (Ri) in remnant racemes and yellow halo leaf spot in macadamia canopy was quantified and the pathogenicity of the fungal isolates obtained from the plant materials was assessed on developing flowers. Ri >90% was recorded for Neopestalotiopsis species from both the remnant racemes and leaf spot, which indicates the materials are a source of inoculum for dry flower disease. Whereas, Ri <40% was recorded for Botrytis species, the causal agent of grey mould, and Ri = 70% for Cladosporium species, the causal agent of green mould, only from remnant racemes. Conidial suspensions and direct incubation with the plant materials resulted in severe flower blights on developing macadamia flowers. Disease severity using inocula from remnant racemes was significantly (P > 0.001) higher than inocula from leaf spot. This information is critical for flower blights control in macadamia orchards.\n\n\n\n",

To understand the importance and impact of diseases present, disease surveys are conducted early and late season across all cotton growing regions to monitor the distribution and incidence of diseases. The surveys also maintain the surveillance for exotic pathogens. Surveys have been conducted in Queensland for 20 consecutive years. Data provided by annual surveys have shown the relative importance of each of the diseases in a region and that specific diseases continue to be a challenge to manage, resulting in significant yield losses. In addition to known endemic diseases we have identified several diseases of cotton for the first time, such as the defoliating pathotype of Verticillium dahliae, a pathogenic yeast Eremothecium coryli (originally Nematospora coryli) that causes seed and boll rot, the plant parasitic nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis, various leaf spot fungi, and a novel species of Eutypella causing a new wilt disease. Although surveillance has provided long term data on the prevalence of diseases, it is the relationships that have been developed over time with growers, agronomists and REOs that have greatly assisted in these new detections. This highlights how important it is for pathologists to have such a network to help keep in touch with what is happening in the field throughout the whole season.\n\n\n\n",

My PhD study addressed some of the research gaps involving the P. teres-barley pathosystem: 1) Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt) populations collected from different continents were genetically characterised and revealed recent/ongoing gene migration among/within different continents. Two field hybrids were also identified. 2) The mating preference between the two forms of P. teres and its hybrids were investigated by crossing different sets of Ptt and Pyrenophora teres f. maculata (Ptm) isolates. This indicated that Ptm did not have a mating preference for the same form but mostly hybridised with Ptt isolates. Ptt isolates had greater reproduction vigour than Ptm isolates under the given laboratory conditions. 3) Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of a Ptt/Ptm cross detected nine QTL associated with virulence and leaf symptoms on five different linkage groups/chromosomes.\n\n\n\n",

His role is to lead the Panama Diagnostic Team providing research, diagnostic and intelligence services on Panama Tropical Race 4 (TR4) disease to support the Panama TR4 Program for early detection of TR4. He also provides diagnostic support for other plant pests and diseases to meet the biosecurity needs of Queensland.\nAbstract\nAfrican citrus greening (or also known as African greening) is a serious, debilitating, insect-transmissible citrus disease associated with the heat sensitive, phloem-limited, non-cultured bacterial species Candidatus Liberibacter africanus (CLaf). Once infecting citrus plants, this disease causes a number of symptoms including foliar blotchy mottle, yellow leaf veins, sparse foliage, and smaller fruits showing ripening color inversion. African greening is exotic to Australia (currently only present in Africa and some Middle East countries) but due to its significant impact on citrus plants, this disease may devastate the Australian citrus industry if it spreads to our country. Early detection of CLaf and its vector (the African citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae) by regular surveillance and diagnostics can protect the citrus industry. A PCR diagnostic assay for CLaf has been developed. However, due to a lack of reference DNA materials and diagnostic skills for the African greening, this assay has not been validated and used for diagnostics. To fill the Australian capability and capacity gaps for diagnostics of African greening, I undertook a two-week diagnostic training at Citrus Research International (CRI), Nelspruit, South Africa in June 2019, funded by Plant Health Australia under the Diagnostic Residential Program. The purposes of my trip were to acquire diagnostic skills for the African greening, as well as to source infected plant materials to generate positive control DNA for the validation of the CLaf PCR diagnostic assay. This presentation will show what I had gained from the training including (1) assessing if the plant is infected with African Greening based on disease symptoms, (2) sampling and diagnosing the disease and also (3) identification of the African citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae.\n\n\n\n",

I have a keen interest in sustainable agriculture and soil micro-biology and am passionate about highlighting the amazing benefits and economic gains to be made when we understand more about the ground beneath our feet.\nAbstract\nMung bean (Vigna radiata) is a short-season high-value legume integrated into grain cropping sequences in the sub-tropical grain region of eastern Australia. It benefits crop rotations through its ability to fix nitrogen (N) from inoculation with Bradyrhizobium. It also forms associations with the beneficial soil-borne arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) which increases plant uptake of phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) in exchange for photosynthates.\nMung bean also hosts the plant-parasitic root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus thornei. Multiplication of P. thornei) in roots can reduce yield of mung bean and subsequent intolerant crops in the sequence. Interactions with AMF and biotic stressors in previous studies suggested that AMF may induce a biocontrol effect to reduce symptom severity and Pratylenchus population density in crops.\nOur research demonstrated that co-inoculation with AMF and Bradyrhizobium synergistically increased (P<0.001) seed yield, shoot biomass, nodulation, biological N fixation and plant nutrition of mung bean cv Jade-AU in glasshouse experiments in a pasteurised vertisol. However, AMF also significantly increased (P<0.05) the population density of P. thornei in mung bean roots, which was not correlated with increased root biomass or improved plant nutrition. Pratylenchus thornei also reduced P and Zn concentration, while increasing N concentration in mycorrhizal shoots.\nIntegrated management to prevent increases in P. thornei in farming systems is imperative so that we can harness the benefits of AMF to improve mung bean yield and nutrition. Rotations with crops that reduce P. thornei populations while increasing AMF inoculum levels in the soils is warranted.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBackground\nPathogens can, and have been observed to, overcome deployed genetic resistance in many crops.\nAdaptation of pathogen populations to genetic resistance is an ongoing “arms race” between the pathogen and pathologists to deploy effective resistance genes before the pathogen population can adapt and overcome them.\nIdentifying where and when these adaptations occur in a growing area is pivotal to successful management of disease.\nPerforming pathogen virulence surveys, as is done for Phytophthora sojae on soybean, is critical for identifying effective resistance genes to a pathogen population.\nIn the case of P. sojae, resistance genes (Rps in this example) have been shown to be effective for 8-20 years, depending on gene deployed and location.\nRegular surveys are therefore conducted to sample and identify effective Rps genes in the sampled population.\nIn previous P. sojae surveys Excel spreadsheets, commonly the Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet, “HaGiS” Excel spread sheet, were used to perform calculation on distribution of susceptible reactions, pathotype complexity, pathotype frequency, as well as alpha diversity indices.\nThis limited the analyses that could be performed to compare between different sampled populations virulence to identify trends in effective resistance genes, i.e., beta-diversity.\nUsing these Excel sheets makes it difficult to not only compare between fields, states or countries pathogen virulence, but also makes reproducibility of these analyses very difficult if not impossible.\nWhile {hagis} was made and validated using Phytophthora sojae virulence data, this package can be used with any pathosystem where plant resistance is conferred in a gene-for-gene fashion.\nHow did {hagis} come to be?\nI (Austin McCoy) started my PhD in 2017 with absolutely no experience in R or RStudio, and started performing a pathotype (virulence) survey of Phytophthora sojae in Michigan to identify effective resistance genes to manage P. sojae in the state.\nAt the time the HaGiS Excel sheet was the primary way research groups were analyzing their P. sojae virulence data, however, it was cumbersome and error prone with few ways to look at the large amounts of data we were generating.\nBy 2019 I had produced quite a bit of isolate virulence data and had started using R, mainly for visualizing other experimental data and performing statistical analysis, while still trying to use the HaGiS Excel sheet.\nThankfully another PhD student at the time, Dr. Zachary Noel, brought up the idea of me performing the HaGiS analyses in R.\nThis R package originally started out as easy to navigate and use R scripts in a .R file.\nIt wasn’t until we got in touch with the Open Plant Pathology group that making these scripts into an R package became a reality.\nIt wasn’t long after that the {hagis} R package was available on GitHub and then CRAN.\nHow is this package being used?\n{hagis} is still a very new package, being released in October 2019.\nThis package is useful to plant pathologists working on pathogen gene-for-gene virulence data identifying effective resistance genes in their respective pathosystems.\nIt provides all analyses that have been used historically to identify effective resistance genes (pathotype complexity, pathotype distribution, individual isolate pathotypes, etc.) but now also has the ability to compare between two, or more, sampled populations to identify differences in resistance gene efficacy (using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Permutation based analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), beta-dispersion and Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM)).\nCurrently, as of July 21st, 2021, {hagis} has been downloaded 10,664 times.\nResearch groups from many states in the United States, as well as South America have published using this package in their own pathogen virulence surveys.\nThe majority of these studies have been with P. sojae, but there has also been some use in other pathosystems, such as frog-eye leaf spot in soybean caused by Cercospora sojina.\nWe are excited to see how this package is used going forward!\nWhat is next?\nWe plan to keep maintaining the {hagis} package as is, but are open to recommendations from users and researchers on future expansions.\nCurrently we are using the package to investigate trends in Rps gene efficacy on a global scale, mining data from previously published P. sojae pathotype surveys.\nWhere do I get the package and more information?\n{hagis} can be downloaded from CRAN and when changes are made a development version can be downloaded on GitHub.\nCRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hagis/index.html\nGitHub: https://github.com/openplantpathology/hagis\nPackage

and extra information in columns removed, let set up the central argument for {hagis} to run on.\nTo do this we can make the argument a list() to be used with all functions in {hagis}, named hagis_args. x = denotes the data set you want to use, in this example we will use the practice data set P_sojae_survey. cutoff = sets the cutoff for susceptible reactions.\nFor example a value of cutoff = 60 indicates that any isolate-plant interaction that results in 60% or more of a susceptible phenotype will be considered susceptible for analyses.\nsample = indicates the column in your data set in which the Isolate identifier is contained (i.e., unique isolate identifier), in this case we will use Isolate.\ngene = Rps identifies the column in which the genes tested are contained, in the practice data that column is named Rps.\nThe final argument, perc_susc = refers to the column in which your calculated percent susceptible reactions for each isolate-gene interaction is

A comprehensive design strategy is essential for allowing target DNA to be detected and non-target DNA to be avoided. Examples of design strategies and research applications will be discussed for two topics. Firstly, specific detection of the barley leaf pathogen Ramularia collo-cygni in Australia. And secondly, genotyping alleles associated with fungicide sensitivity, reduced sensitivity and resistance in the barley net blotch pathogens Pyrenophora teres f. teres and P. teres f. maculata. The development of detection workflows for these pathosystems provides a robust process for investigating the presence and frequency of pathogens and fungicide resistance.\n\n\n\n",

Some minor changes in the flow of the code were necessitated by changes in the output of functions in {pliman} and changes in the function names. The results should remain the same.\nIntroduction\nTwo weeks ago I came across {pliman}, a new R package developed by Tiago Olivoto that provides a suite of functions for conducting several analyses on images of plants.\nFor obvious reasons, I was greatly interested in testing a function that allows measuring plant disease severity - or the percentage leaf area affected.\nMore than two dozen software, most of them proprietary, have been used for measuring percentage severity in phytopathometry research (Del Ponte et al. 2017).\nAs far as I know, there is no specialized R package or one with functions built particularly for plant disease severity measurement.\nThe availability of these image analysis tools is of great importance mainly for research purposes or situations when the most accurate severity is necessary (Bock et al. 2020).\nExamples include the development of standard area diagrams (set of images of leaves with known severity) as well as their validation when an “actual” severity measurement is required.\nThese images are usually obtained under standardized conditions (light and background) and analyzed individually.\nHowever, a batch processing can automate and greatly speed up the process - which is of course beneficial in any research field.\nIn this post I will demonstrate how to measure severity using the sympmatic_area() function of {pliman} to measure severity in 10 leaves (batch processing) infected with soybean rust.\nI will further compare the measures with ones determined using QUANT software as used in a previous work (Franceschi et al. 2020).\nWhat is healthy and diseased?\nThe most critical step is the initial step - this avoids garbage in, garbage out, when the user needs to correctly define the color palettes, which in {pliman} are separate images representing each of three classes named background (b), symptomatic (s) and healthy (h).\nThese reference image palettes can be made simply by manually sampling small areas of the image and producing a composite image. Of course, the results may vary significantly depending on how these areas are chosen, and are subjective in nature due to the researchers experience.\nThe observation of the processed masks becomes important to create image palettes that are most representative of the respective class.\nHere, I cut and pasted several sections of images representative of each class from a few leaves into a Google slide.\nOnce the image palette was ready, I exported each one as a separate image PNG file (JPG also works).\nThese were named: sbr_b.png, sbr_h.png and sbr_s.png.\n\nNow that we have the image palettes, we can start by importing the image palettes into the environment for further analysis. Let’s create an image object for each palette named h (healthy), s (symptoms) and b (background).\n\n\n# install.packages(\"pliman\")\n# note that pliman requires R version 4 and EBImage pkg\n# install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n# BiocManager::install(\"EBImage\")\n\nlibrary(pliman)\nh <- image_import(\"sbr_h.png\")\ns <- image_import(\"sbr_s.png\")\nb <- image_import(\"sbr_b.png\")\n\n\nWe can visualize the imported images using the image_combine() function.\n\n\nimage_combine(h, s, b, ncol = 3)\n\n\n\nMeasuring severity\nSingle image\nTo determine severity in a single image (img46.png), the image file needs to be loaded and assigned to an object using the same image_import() function used to load the palettes for each of the predefined classes.\nWe can then visualize the image, again using image_combine().\n\n\nimg <- image_import(\"originals/img46.png\")\nimage_combine(img)\n\n\n\nNow the fun begins with the measure_disease() function to determine severity.\nFour arguments are needed, the one representing the target image and each of the three images of the color palettes.\nAs the author of the package says “pliman will take care of all details!”\n\n\nmeasure_disease(\n  img = img,\n  img_healthy = h,\n  img_symptoms = s,\n  img_background = b,\n  show_image = TRUE\n)\n\n\n$severity\n   healthy symptomatic\n1 93.51542    6.484583\n\n$shape\nNULL\n\n$statistics\nNULL\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"plm_disease\"\n\nLots of images\nThat was fun, but usually we don’t have a single image to process but several.\nIt would take a longer time to process each one using the above procedure, thus becoming tedious.\nTo automate the process, {pliman} offers a batch processing approach.\nFor such, instead of using img argument, one can use img_pattern and define the prefix of names of the images.\nIn addition, we also need to define the folder where the original files are located.\nIf the users wants to save the processed masks, the save_image argument needs to be set to TRUE and the directory where the images will be saved also should be informed.\nCheck below how to process 10 images of soybean rust symptoms.\nThe outcome is a list object with the measures of the percent healthy and percent symptomatic area for each leaf in the severity object.\n\n\npliman <- measure_disease(\n  pattern = \"img\",\n  dir_original = \"originals\" ,\n  dir_processed = \"processed\",\n  save_image = TRUE,\n  img_healthy = h,\n  img_symptoms = s,\n  img_background = b,\n  show_image = FALSE\n)\n\nProcessing image img11 |===                            | 10% 00:00:00 \nProcessing image img35 |======                         | 20% 00:00:00 \nProcessing image img37 |=========                      | 30% 00:00:00 \nProcessing image img38 |============                   | 40% 00:00:01 \nProcessing image img46 |================               | 50% 00:00:01 \nProcessing image img5 |===================             | 60% 00:00:01 \nProcessing image img63 |======================         | 70% 00:00:02 \nProcessing image img67 |=========================      | 80% 00:00:03 \nProcessing image img70 |============================   | 90% 00:00:03 \nProcessing image img75 |===============================| 100% 00:00:03 \n\nseverity <- pliman$severity\nseverity\n\n     img  healthy symptomatic\n1  img11 72.29332  27.7066842\n2  img35 31.43099  68.5690069\n3  img37 59.62081  40.3791869\n4  img38 80.02540  19.9746040\n5  img46 92.88336   7.1166394\n6   img5 18.73394  81.2660577\n7  img63 97.27247   2.7275251\n8  img67 99.85551   0.1444926\n9  img70 30.46107  69.5389308\n10 img75 92.76616   7.2338404\n\nWith the argument save_image set to TRUE, the images are all saved in the folder with the standard prefix “proc”.\n\nHow good are these measures?\nThese 10 images were previously processed in QUANT software for determining severity.\nLet’s create a tibble for the image code and respective “actual” severity - assuming QUANT’s measures as reference.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nquant <- tribble(\n  ~img, ~actual,\n   \"img5\",     75,\n  \"img11\",     24,\n  \"img35\",     52,\n  \"img37\",     38,\n  \"img38\",     17,\n  \"img46\",      7,\n  \"img63\",    2.5,\n  \"img67\",   0.25,\n  \"img70\",     67,\n  \"img75\",     10\n  )\n\n\nWe can now combine the two dataframes and produce a scatter plot relating the two measures.\n\n\ndat <- left_join(severity, quant)\n\ndat %>%\n  ggplot(aes(actual, symptomatic)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ylim(0, 100) +\n  xlim(0, 100) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Quant\",\n       y = \"pliman\")\n\n\n\nThe concordance correlation coefficient is a test for agreement between two observers or two methods.\nIt is an indication of how accurate the {pliman} measures are compared with a standard.\nThe coefficient is greater than 0.97 (1.0 is perfect concordance), suggesting an excellent agreement!\n\n\nlibrary(epiR)\nccc <- epi.ccc(dat$actual, dat$symptomatic)\nccc$rho.c\n\n        est     lower     upper\n1 0.9767523 0.9304934 0.9923465\n\nConclusion\nThe community of R users may enjoy using {pliman} as an alternative to proprietary software or other point-and-click open source solutions such as imageJ.\nThe simplicity of the batch processing approach can greatly improve the speed of the assessment and the user can set arguments to run R in parallel for enhanced computational speed.\nThe most critical step, as I mentioned, is the definition of the reference color palettes.\nA few preliminary runs may be needed for a few leaves to check whether the segmentation is being performed correctly, based on visual judgement.\nThis is no different than any other color-threshold based methods when the choices made by the user affect the final result and contribute to variation among assessors (Bock et al. 2009).\nThe cons are the same encountered in the direct competitors, which is the necessity to have images obtained at uniform and controlled conditions, especially a contrasting background.\nColophon\nThis post was constructed using R Version 4.2.2 (R Core Team 2021) {pliman} version 1.1.0.\n\n\n\nBock, C.

    "contents": "\nAs botanical and agricultural sciences were firmly established from the mid-19th century, plant pathology also emerged and matured as a discipline of its own. Formal academic departments and societies were being formed to develop a united front for the budding field of plant pathology. The Royal Netherlands Phytopathology Society was the first organised society to establish in 1891, driven by Prof Hugo de Vries, Prof Jacob Eriksson and Dr Jan Ritzema Bos, and is recognised as the oldest society.\nThe foundation of a phytopathology institute in the Netherlands came with challenges, political and financial, however after 3 years, through the private support of an Amersterdam trader, the Willie Commelin Scholten (WCS) Phytopathology Laboratory was established. In 1906, Dr Johanna Westerdijk, 23-years old and a recently graduated Swiss botanist, accepted the position as the successor to Ritzema Bos (the director of the Institute for Phytopathology, in Wageningen, 1905) as the director of the WCS laboratory.\nCartoon of Johanna Westerdijk inspecting samples in laboratory bench. Caption: Johanna Westerdijk (1883-1961) was an energetic, people-oriented, intelligent and fundamental science-focused oriented woman and researcher. It is not surprise that within 11 years, Dr. Westerdijk was promoted at the University of Utrecht to Prof. of Phytopathology - the first female Professor in the NetherlandsAt the beginning of her tenure, Dr Westerdijk was requested to take care of Frits Went’s fungal cultures, initiating the Central Bureau of Fungal Cultures (Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, CBS), in 1907. As an energetic, people-orientated, intelligent and fundamental science-focused woman and researcher, it is no surprise that within 11 years, Dr Westerdijk was promoted at the University of Utrecht to professor of phytopathology - the first female professor in the Netherlands.\nThe growth under Westerdijk, required a joint venture between the University of Amsterdam and the University of Utrecht, to be initiated, moving the WCS laboratory and the CBS to Baarn, in 1920. The CSB was initiated with 50 cultures, deposited by Went, but at the time of Westerdijks retirement, almost 9000 cultures were curated by the CBS, now at the Utrecht Science Park (directed by Prof. Pedro Crous). To honour Johanna Westerdijk, the collection is now known as the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. During her role as director and professor, Westerdijk tackled problems (and low expectations from her male peers) with a headstrong and practical approach, diagnosing and providing extension reports for damping-off in sugar beets, caused by Phoma betea. However, Westerdijk was so fascinated by the Dutch elm disease, after it was first noticed in 1919, that she decided to focus her research with intention on this single disease.\nAs Westerdijk had great people skills she managed to encourage almost 1000 municipalities to invest in research to prevent elms in their districts from being infected. Not only could she gather funds, but people, Westerdijk supported her female peers and eagerly collaborated with them. Working with Barendina Spierenburg and Marie Beatrice Schwarz, they attempted to prove the causal organism of this devastating epidemic. Perhaps, to the dismay of many senior male researchers, Westerdijk and her team, as well as a new female graduate student, Christine Buisman (unfortunately, passing away in 1936), managed to prove the Ophiostoma novo-ulmi (then Graphium ulmi) was causing Dutch elm disease. Female students and staff under the supervision of Westerdijk continued to research applied strategies to control this wilting disease of elm, through chemotherapy (which was not pursued in-depth due to phytotoxicity) and a successful breeding program - of which trees are still being enjoyed today in the Netherlands.\nIn 1945 Westerdijk was the president of the Royal Netherlands Phytopathology Society and continued on as a phytopathologist of international calibre, studying in Switzerland and Germany, visiting Indonesia, the United States and forming close collaborations and friendships with South African researchers. With the retirement of Westerdijk in 1952, she handed over the reins to her successor, Prof. Louise Kerling. Her passing in 1961, left a legacy for plant pathology not only in the Netherlands but abroad too. Described as a joyful and spirited woman, Westerdijk lived by the motto: ‘For fine minds, the art is, to mix work and parties’, ‘Werken en feesten vormt schone geesten’_, she managed to break glass ceilings and build beautiful bridges, so we may all benefit from her and her team’s contributions. The above is a blurb inspired by an article to commemorate Johanna Westerdijk in the European Journal of Plant Pathology (2019) by Boonekamp et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBackground\nBacterial wilt pathogens in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) are destructive pathogens, especially in tropical and sub-tropical climates with year-round precipitation. Most strains in this species complex are soil-borne pathogens that cause persistant infestations once introduced. Tomato, potato, tobacco, banana, ginger, and peanut are crops that are well-recognized hosts of Ralstonia. In 2005, Mark Fegan and Philippe Prior formalized a DNA-based taxonomy for the RSSC called a “phylotype-sequevar” system . Since their publication, hundreds of plant pathologists around the world have classified the population diversity of the RSSC on specific crops or in geographic regions.\nWhat is the database for?\nRSSCdb is a database of characterized strains of Ralstonia solanacearum species complex strains whose data have extracted from the peer-reviewed articles that include the geographic, host of origin, year, and phylogenetic classification (phylotype/sequevar). This strain metadata is available in the main text or supplemental material of the publication. The project was developed to provide UC Davis undergraduate researchers with a remote research experience. The data will be supplemental material for a systematic review article to be submitted for publication after data collection is finalized (Lowe-Power et al. unpublished). In the interim, the data is released on BioRxiv and GitHub after UC Davis students complete their thesis (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.189936v1).\nHow is it developed?\nThe database is organized in an Excel spreadsheet, a format that facilitates regular curation of data entry.\nWhat’s next?\nEmerson M. Del Ponte will advise a student on creating an interactive dashboard to view the data, similar to his FGSCdb for tracking species and chemotypes of the Fusarium graminearum species complex: https://fgsc.netlify.app/\nWe would like to extend the utility of the Ralstonia diversity project by allowing other researches to contribute raw data to populate the global map.

The clubroot pathogen, as final step of its life cycle, releases resting spores to the soil where they can remain viable for up to 20 years (Peng et al. 2015), making the management of the disease very difficult. For growers, to know the distribution of the pathogen is key to avoid the introduction of infested soil and to perform the proper disinfestation if machinery from fellow farmers is used in their lands.\nWhat is the database for?\nClubrootTracker is an open database to record the presence of clubroot disease. This project was published as a Resource Announcement in Plant Health Progress (Muirhead et al. 2020), and a full article will be published once new locations are recorded.\nHow it is developed?\nClubrootTracker is an interactive map tool written in the Bootstrap version 3.3.7 web framework using leaflet.js (https://leafletjs.com) and a JavaScript library for the interactive map user interface. Using Python, GPS data was converted into a GeoJSON file, allowing to render the data points of the areas affected by clubroot.\nScreenshots of the ClubrootTracker tool showing the start page, menu and a selected locationWhat’s next?\nWe would like to include worldwide clubroot distribution data.

    "contents": "\nBackground\nA definition for Standard area diagram set (SAD, also known as diagrammatic scales or disease diagrams): a generic term for a pictorial or graphic representation of selected percent severity on plant parts generally used as an aid for more accurate visual estimation (percent scale) or classification (using an ordinal scale) of severity on a specimen.\nThe first known SAD was published by Cobb (1892)accompanying an ordinal scale (1, 5 10, 20 and 50% severity) originally used for ‘classifying’ rather than interpolation to the nearest percent estimate. It was during the late 1960s that a plethora of SADs have been proposed and further published by Clive James, in an influential article in the Canadian Plant Disease Survey (James 1971) with “assessment keys” for 19 diseases. Two decades later, a list of several SADs developed during that period was presented in Campbell and Madden (1990) book and, more recently, in a review article that listed 105 peer-review studies on SADs published between 1991 and 2017 (Del Ponte et al. 2017). SAD research is very active and results have shown that an “average rater” will likely benefit from the use of SAD to “calibrate” his eye during the assessment and improve accuracy. Collectively, estimates by different raters are more reliable when aided with SADs (Del Ponte et al. 2017).\nWhat is the database for?\nThe goal of the database is to serve as a central repository of SAD research studies where plant pathologists can refer to when searching SADs for specific diseases.\nHow is it developed?\nThe data is organized as a Google Sheet file and an interface to consult the database was developed using R Markdown.\nWhat’s next?\nCurrently, the database contains 170 SADs (as of March 2021) found in peer-reviewed articles published after 1990, but previous works will also be included. A preview image of the SAD will be included in future versions.\nProject website: sadbank.netlify.appData source: github.com/emdelponte/sadbankAuthor and maintainer: Emerson M.

    "contents": "\nWe are starting our #OPPtoons series with one of the famous plant pathologists responsible for providing the grounds for establishing the discipline of plant disease epidemiology, James Edward Vanderplank (VDP; 1908 - 1997). His ideas and simple mathematical formulation on how plant diseases develop and spread over time were game-changing, unifying thoughts and arguing ecological principles for use in disease progress. He set the groundwork for equipping plant pathologists with a toolbox for the analysis of epidemics and, as Vanderplank would say “set the strategy” for the control of plant diseases.\nCartoon of JE Vanderplank teaching a class in muddy work clothes. Caption: JE Vanderplank (1908–1997), a “Boots on the ground” researcher, teaching and leading plant disease epidemiology from the front in a courteous and modest manner. His seminal and further ideas have definitely changed the face of plant pathology and breeding.Born in the rural village of Eshowe, South Africa, VDP grew into a fond natural and agricultural scientist with academic training in botany, plant ecology and chemistry, taking his role in contributing to plant health seriously, and at an international level. While leading the Division of Plant Protection (1958) and directing a newly formed Plant Protection Research Institute in South Africa (1962), VDP published his famous solo author book “Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control” at the age of 55. This fundamental manuscript was announced during the first International Epidemiology Workshop held in 1963, in France, a turning point for the formation of the studying plant disease epidemics. Vanderplank wrote several book chapters and more solo author books in the following decades, even after retiring in 1973 (Coutinho, Drenth, and Wingfield 2020).\nNot only did VDP contribute written materials, but also to the potato breeding program and citrus post-harvest sanitation in South Africa. Amongst his peers and students, he was considered a humble, “boots on the ground” researcher, teaching and leading from the front in a courteous and modest manner. His seminal and further ideas have been supported and challenged by plant pathologists from his and future generations, but one thing remains in common - all express admiration for his work that definitely changed the face of plant pathology and breeding. Together with his peers, VDP set the cornerstone of plant disease epidemiology, being crowned as a maverick, as the father of Plant Disease Epidemiology\" (Zadoks and Schein 1988) and the “founding father of modern quantitative [Botanical] Epidemiology” Thresh (1998). In a world continually affected by epidemics and pandemics, we are glad to honour this giant whose shoulders have been a solid platform to build upon, with our first #OPPtoon.\n\n\n\nCoutinho, Teresa A., André Drenth, and Michael J.

The current release (version 1.0) contains 14,405 cured isolates and 2989 literature references of 12,121 different host–fungus interactions with 1692 different plant species from 149 countries.\nBackground\nBotryosphaeriaceae-related diseases occur worldwide in a wide variety of plant hosts. The number of studies targeting the distribution, diversity, ecology, and pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae species are consistently increasing. However, with the lack of consistency in species delimitation, the name of hosts, and the locations of studies, it is almost impossible to quantify the presence of these species worldwide, or the number of different host–fungus interactions that occur. In a recently published paper (Batista, Lopes, and Alves 2021), we collected and organized Botryosphaeriaceae occurrences in a single cured data set, allowing us to obtain for the first time a complete perspective on species’ global diversity, dispersion, host association, ecological niches, pathogenicity, communication efficiency of new occurrences, and new host–fungus associations.\nWhat is the database for?\nThe MDRBOT database was built using R 3.6.0 with a web shiny interface. The website includes a search engine to find the cured Botryosphaeriaceae isolates from the Nucleotide—NCBI database and for the host–fungus interaction data set, where the user can perform multiple field search and download the output in an excel format file (.xlsx).\nA worldwide map generator tool for species occurrence is available, where the user can select an input species and generate a world occurrence map. A climate data analysis is included, where the user can select an input species and observe isolates with valid geographical information and evaluate the main climate variables associated with these records (minimum, average and maximum annual temperature, and minimum, average, and maximum annual precipitation). The option to download the output maps as a portable network graphics file (.png) for both occurrence and climate data analyses is also available.\nHow is it developed?\nData Extraction from Nucleotide—NCBI Database\nAn initial query was performed on 12-05-2020 in the Nucleotide—NCBI database using the search term “Botryosphaeriaceae [Organism]” with the R package rentrez. In total, 49,955 sequences were retrieved. Information such as organism, strain/culture collection, host, geographical coordinates, country, and the title of publication were also extracted.\nScreening was performed by removing duplicates and records without a strain or culture collection number. For each isolate, when available, sequences from the internal transcribed spacer region of rRNA region (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α), beta-tubulin (tub2), second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2), and two alternate forms of the MAT locus (MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1) were selected.\nAll the sequences were grouped by the strain or culture collection number and all features were manually standardized. Special characters were removed from the strain/culture collection feature and organized by the main culture collections. Geographical coordinates were transformed to the decimal form of the WGS84 geodetic datum and countries’ names were organized according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference system. Host names were cured according to the Catalogue of Life: 2019 Annual Checklist from the CoL+ project .\nClimate variables were extracted from the Climatologies at a high resolution for the Earth’s land surface areas project (CHELSA) only for records with geographical coordinates. The organism name was verified and updated according to recent literature and a sequence quality screening was performed by running a pairwise blast analysis between the ITS of each isolate against the sequence of the type of each genus. Isolates with a similarity lower than 94.3% were removed.\nData Extraction from U.S. National Fungus Collections\nA query was performed by genus (Alanphillipsia, Barriopsis, Botryobambusa, Botryosphaeria, Cophinforma, Diplodia, Dothiorella, Endomelanconiopsis, Eutiarosporella, Lasiodiplodia, Macrophomina, Marasasiomyces, Mucoharknessia, Neodeightonia, Neofusicoccum, Neoscytalidium, Oblongocollomyces, Phaeobotryon, Sardiniella, Sphaeropsis) on 12-05-2020. Data regarding fungus–host interactions were extracted and organized by country, year, and citation. In total, 22,698 host–fungus interactions were extracted. Similarly, to the previous screening, duplicates were removed, and all features were standardized by the same rules .\nMDRBOT Database and Shiny Interface\nA literature review was performed, and both data sets were analyzed to fill missing information. Several extra organization-level features were built to allow different filter functions. A shiny interface was created to allow easy access to both data sets.\n\nWhat is next?\nTo help future editions of this database is important that authors upload all isolates information in genbank consistently. For countries names please use ISO 3166 standards and for the host please confirm if your species name is accepted by the CoL+ Project. If you have geographical coordinates, please add it to your genbank submission. For records already present in our database you can upload your information by email to us (Eduardobatista@ua.pt).\nProject details\nProject website: https://mdr-bot-cesam-ua.shinyapps.io/bot_database/Authors: Eduardo Batista, Anabela Lopes, Artur AlvesMaintainer: Eduardo Batista, Anabela Lopes, Artur AlvesCurrent collaborators (raw data): Eduardo Batista, Anabela Lopes, Artur Alves\n\n\n\nBatista, Eduardo, Anabela Lopes, and Artur Alves. 2021. “What Do We Know about Botryosphaeriaceae?

Among these, the globally commercialized Cavendish. These cultivars are susceptible to the devastating Panama Disease caused by Fusarium odoratissimum (AKA Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense Tropical Race 4). In this presentation, we will explore the past, present and future of complex relationship bananas- Fusarium. We will dig into the history and explore the impact of the epic epidemic of Panama disease (Race 1) that devastated Gros Michel bananas in the previous century, how Cavendish saved the industry and the re-emergence of the threat. Finally, we will discuss the possible solutions for disease management focusing on the plant breeding efforts.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBackground\nMembers of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), an ascomycete fungus, rank among the most dangerous plant pathogens worldwide. These mycotoxigenic fungi affect mainly small grain crops such as wheat and barley, but also maize, rice and other important cereal crops. During the first decade of 2000, employing multilocus sequencing of global collections of strains that were morphologically defined as a single panmictic species previously known as “Fusarium graminearum,” 16 species have been described (K. O’Donnell et al. 2000; Kerry O’Donnell et al. 2004, 2008; Starkey et al. 2007; Yli-Mattila et al. 2009; Sarver et al. 2011). Since then, researchers from all over the world have been surveying cereal crops and identifying these newly discovered phylogenetic species and associated toxin profile using molecular tools (Backhouse 2014; van der Lee et al. 2015; AOKI et al. 2012). An European database of chemotypes has been developed (Pasquali et al. 2016).\nWhat is the database for?\nFGSCdb is an open database of characterized FGSC strains whose data have been gathered directly from researchers or extracted from peer-reviewed articles whenever the geographic, host of origin, year, and phylogenetic species (and associated trichothecene chemotype/genotype whenever available) information are available in the main text or supplemental material of the publication. The project was developed as supplemental material for a systematic review article to be submitted soon for publication (Del Ponte et al. unpublished).\nHow is it developed?\nThe database is organized in a Google Sheet, an online spreadsheet that facilitates shared work and collaboration. Scripts to gather the data and prepare grid, plot and map visualizations were developed using several R packages including crosstalk for adding interactivity in the grid and map view. The main packages used were leaflet for maps, datatable for grid view and plotly for dynamic plotting. The website is constructed using the distill R package. The raw data can be downloaded in PDF or excel format.\nWhat’s next?\nWe would like to extend the utility of this project by allowing other researches to contribute data to populate the global map.

The equations provide a good fit to actual data collected in field populations of both monocyclic and polycyclic epidemics.\nThe mathematics behind model fitting is straightforward and can be done using linear regression as far as the original data is transformed to linearize the pattern of the curve.\nAlternatively, non-linear approaches can also be used, but require computational resources.\nHow did {epifitter} happen?\nDuring my journey teaching a graduate course in plant disease epidemiology since late 2007 I have used different approaches when teaching the fitting of models to DPC data.\nIn the beginning, I made use of SAS codes, a DOS-based software and a spreadsheet.\nIn 2014, I became an R and RStudio user and since then never looked back and abandoned all other software.\nI was trying to use only R for teaching and analysing epidemic data, which was quite possible for most, but not all, my epidemiological analyses at the time.\nI have been writing my teaching notes in R and improving (as well as shortening!) my codes each year since.\nIn 2018, my MSc student, Kaique Alves, started to program in R after he joined my lab and attended my epidemiology class.\nI was providing the codes for the class and, at some point when explaining an exercise on model fitting.\nDuring that course, I challenged Kaique to implement functions for automating the process of model fitting, selection and plotting.\nOne year after Kaique completed the course, {epifitter} was born and it took a few more months to be delivered on GitHub and finally on CRAN in October 2020.\nHow is it being used?\n{epifitter} is a very young package, targeting students and researchers dealing with simulated or empirically-derived data collected from surveys or experiments.\nIt provides a set of tools for aiding in the visualization and description of DPCs as well as fitting and comparing epidemic models and simulating epidemic data.\nThe models fitted to data are the “classic” population dynamics models (e.g., Gompertz, logistic, monomolecular) using both the data linearization and the non-linear approaches for both single or multiple epidemics, making this package useful for both research and teaching purposes.\nAs of March the 3rd, the package has been downloaded 2,321 times (~600 downloads/month).\nRecently, I used {epifitter} in my graduate (online inter-institutional) epidemiology class with great success.\nThe few functions optimized to simplify model fitting and selection shorten the learning curve because students need to learn just a few R functions compared with my original codes.\nThis is also valid for visualizing model results. Additionally, we have used the package in ongoing research in the lab that deals with disease progress data.\nThe chapter on model fitting of my “R4 Plant Disease Epidemiology” book (which is in the making) is based solely on {epifitter}.\nFinally, it has also been used in a vignette of the epicrop package and other research projects associated with the use of the latter package to calculate area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC).\nWhat is next?\nThe plan is to keep maintaining and expanding by creating a few other functions.\nWe are gathering information for developing functions for comparing epidemic parameters obtained from epidemic data coming from different experimental designs, such as randomized blocks design.\nFurthermore, we plan to create functions to fit disease gradient models, add data sets and expand the documentation (via blog posts and screencast tutorials) to facilitate the understanding of package use and provide more examples.\nWhere to get the package?\n{epifitter} can be downloaded from CRAN and its development version from GitHub.\nCRAN: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{epifitter}/index.html>\nGH: <https://github.com/AlvesKS/{epifitter}>\nPackage documentation: https://alvesks.github.io/{epifitter}/\nR4PDE: <https://emdelponte.github.io/epidemiology-R/fitting-models.html>\nAuthors\nKaique dos Santos Alves\nEmerson Medeiros Del Ponte\nExamples\nCreate the pepper data set available from the book “The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics” Madden, Hughes, and van den Bosch (2017) chapter 4, page 93.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(epifitter)\npepper <-\n  tibble::tribble(\n    ~t, ~`1`, ~`2`, ~`3`,\n    0, 0.08, 0.001, 0.001,\n    7, 0.13, 0.01, 0.001,\n    14, 0.78, 0.09, 0.01,\n    21, 0.92, 0.25, 0.05,\n    28, 0.99, 0.8, 0.18,\n    35, 0.995, 0.98, 0.34,\n    42, 0.999, 0.99, 0.48,\n    49, 0.999, 0.999, 0.74\n  )\n\n\nPlot curve 1\n\n\nggplot(pepper, aes(t, `1`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\nModel fitting\nUsing data linearization approach with the fit_lin() function\n\n\nepi1 <- fit_lin(time = pepper$t,\n                y = pepper$`1`)\n\n\nInspect model parameter estimates\nThe models are ranked from highest to lowest CCC.

(2016).\nResults of a recent survey (Del Ponte, unpublished) showed that more than 50 meta-analysis articles have been published using plant disease-related data, mainly to test treatment effects on disease severity and yield, but also their relationship, among other effects of interest.\nAlthough this is a VERY small number of studies compared with other fields (medicine and psychology), a trend towards increasing its use in our field is evident.\nSpecifically, multiple treatment comparison (e.g., fungicides and biocontrol agents) is usually of interest and these treatments are usually compared with a common treatment, the untreated check, with their effects (relative control) thus being correlated.\nHence, this post is for those interest in learning how to fit network meta-analysis models, in particular the frequentist and arm-based approach (as opposed to contrast-based) using open source tools, as alternative to SAS and other commercial software.\nHere, I reproduce the analysis shown in a paper where the authors made available all the data (wheat yield response to fungicides), as well as SAS codes Madden et al. (2016), using an MA-specific package of R, {metafor}.\nHere I fitted the same model, the arm-based or unconditional, similar to the original paper.\nIn that case, his approach the effect sizes are directly the treatment means and not the difference or ratio as traditionally performed in meta-analysis).\nI will reproduce some, not all, of the arm-based models presented in the original paper using {metafor}.\nI will explain most of the important details about how to prepare the data, visualize the responses, fit the models and compare results with the original paper.\nAnyone should be able to reproduce the analysis below by copying and pasting into R.\nTo facilitate instant access and reproducibility, I created an RStudio project in the cloud where anyone can run this code and get the same results.\nClick here to get access to the RStudio project in the cloud.\nData preparation\nThe data were obtained from the supplemental FileS1, a SAS file that contains the documented code and the data.\nHere, the data were organized in one MS Excel file following the same original structure and content, excepting that missing data was represented by an empty cell.\nLet’s load some packages for data importing and wrangling.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # load several useful pkgs\nlibrary(readxl) # import excel data\n\n\nNow we are ready to import the data and convert both yield and variance to metric unit as performed in the paper.\nNote: we do not need to create the weight variable as in the SAS code because this is handled in the meta-analysis specific R packages.\n\n\nwheat0 <- read_excel(\"wheat.xlsx\")\nwheat <- wheat0 %>%\n  mutate(varyld = (1 / wtyield) * (0.0628 ^ 2),\n         yield = yield * 0.0628) %>%\n  na.omit() # here we omit the rows with missing data\n\n\nLet’s replace the names of the levels of the treatment factor from numbers to the fungicide treatment acronym.\n\n\nwheat <- wheat %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 10, \"CTRL\")) %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 2, \"TEBU\")) %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 3, \"PROP\")) %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 4, \"PROT\")) %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 5, \"TEBU+PROT\")) %>%\n  mutate(trt = replace(trt, trt == 6, \"MET\"))\n\n\nMeta-analytic (arm-based) model\nI use here the {metafor} package, a free and open-source add-on for conducting meta-analyses with the statistical software environment R.\nI followed the example for fitting the arm-based network MA as shown in this presentation and this documentation by the author of the package.\nIn the original NMA paper, the authors compared three different variance-covariance matrix for a random-effects model: compound symmetry (CS), heterogeneous CS (HCS) and unstructured (UN).\nThese can be informed directly in the rma.mv() function.\nOK, let’s load {metafor} package now.\n\n\nlibrary(metafor)\n\n\nNow we can fit the first model, model R1 in the paper, with compound symmetry (CS) structure for the variance-covariance matrix Madden et al. (2016).\nThis is used because all treatments within a study share the same random effect, all treatments are correlated, with a covariance for pairs of treatments given by the between-study variance Madden et al. (2016).\nWe use the rma.mv() function that allows fitting mixed effects model for multivariate and multi-treatment situations.\nThe first two arguments are the effect of interest, which is yield (means of the treatment of interest across replicates within the same trial) and the sampling variance varyld (e.g., the residual variance obtained from the fit of an ANOVA like model).\nOur moderators is the factor of interest, in our case treatment trt.\nThe method is the maximum likelihood.\nThe random component will be treatment and trial, meaning a random intercept for treatments within trials, which are also random.\nThe struct is CS and the data is wheat.\n\n\nnet_arm_CS <- rma.mv(\n  yield,\n  varyld,\n  mods = ~ trt,\n  method = \"ML\",\n  random = list( ~ trt | factor(trial)),\n  struct = \"CS\",\n  data = wheat\n)\n\n\nWe call the summary results of the model.\nLet’s jump straight to model results where we can check the estimates for each treatment which are the differences to the intercept, defined as the untreated check.\nWe can see that MET (0.436 ton) and PROP (0.20 ton) provided the highest and lowest numerical yield difference relative to the untreated (intercept).\nWe should also look at the 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nsummary(net_arm_CS)\n\n\nMultivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 558; method: ML)\n\n   logLik   Deviance        AIC        BIC       AICc   \n-283.5052  1710.1250   583.0105   617.6054   583.2728   \n\nVariance Components:\n\nouter factor: factor(trial) (nlvls = 136)\ninner factor: trt           (nlvls = 6)\n\n            estim    sqrt  fixed \ntau^2      1.5516  1.2456     no \nrho        0.9841             no \n\nTest for Residual Heterogeneity:\nQE(df = 552) = 55024.7841, p-val < .0001\n\nTest of Moderators (coefficients 2:6):\nQM(df = 5) = 319.9986, p-val < .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\n              estimate      se     zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \nintrcpt         3.5335  0.1076  32.8500  <.0001  3.3227  3.7443  *** \ntrtMET          0.4360  0.0309  14.1295  <.0001  0.3755  0.4965  *** \ntrtPROP         0.1994  0.0361   5.5206  <.0001  0.1286  0.2702  *** \ntrtPROT         0.4286  0.0365  11.7560  <.0001  0.3572  0.5001  *** \ntrtTEBU         0.2744  0.0258  10.6558  <.0001  0.2239  0.3249  *** \ntrtTEBU+PROT    0.4326  0.0306  14.1523  <.0001  0.3727  0.4925  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nHeterogeneous CS\nAlternatively, between-study variance can be considered unequal when there is an overall random study effect.\nIn this model, there is a constant between-study correlation for all pairs of treatments with unequal between-study total variances, and this matrix is called heterogeneous compound symmetry (HCS).\nThis the R2 model in Madden et al.

We come to think of diseases as always being associated with a pathogen, and we almost invariably consider the pathogen as the ‘cause’ of the disease. Of course, this contravenes the central tenet of the disease triangle: ignoring the role of the environment limits our understanding of the disease presentation. Furthermore, given a climate that is changing in front of our eyes, there is the strong prospect that the role of the pathogen will likewise change through the prism of the disease triangle. In this presentation, Dr. Young will explore the epidemiology of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) leaf drop in Sumatra and Malaysia, presenting field work undertaken in 2019 and with reference to real-world examples of the role of climate in what we term ‘disease.’ During this presentation he will explore the case against the foliar pathogen Pestalotiopsis in relation to rubber leaf drop and discuss more generally the principles of plant pathology.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nAs some may know you are a Colombian researcher in Wageningen (NL) at KeyGene, recently promoted to Principal Researcher. Currently, leading a banana breeding program, focusing on Panama Disease, i.e. Fusarium Wilt of Banana. How did this become a passion for you?\nI’ve been passionate about plant sciences since I can remember, I really enjoyed my former work, and am excited about my current opportunity as well. Before working with bananas and Fusarium, I worked with coffee and coffee-leaf rust. I was passionate, creative and innovative… but of course, showing that passion publicly was difficult 15 years ago without social media. Nowadays, we have many platforms to explore and show our passion for our work and careers. My motto is: ‘enjoy life’ and I try my best to do so. I work hard, and I’m can be very serious, but I try to find the most efficient and a fun way to do my work.  Fusarium wilt, the topic of my current research, is very a serious disease and touches all levels of society, as bananas are not only a snack for some but a staple food in many regions, including my own. I spend a lot of time and effort to become a better scientist and contribute to solving this problem.\n\nWhen did you realize you had a love for drawing and in particular cartoons of plant diseases/pathogens?\nAlong with my love for plant sciences, I also have a love for art - especially drawing caricatures. I have been drawing these, since I was a kid, I particularly like caricatures. I used to draw famous artists and writers and make little biographies of them using my cartoons. Then as I grew older, I started to draw my classmates and teachers which put me into trouble many times as caricatures are a difficult thing… you know? Not everyone likes to be a caricature. When I started to work as a researcher in the coffee breeding centre a colleague of mine really enjoyed my caricatures and she asked if I would draw a caricature for an event of entomophagy (this is the technical term for insect eating…). I drew a grasshopper with chopsticks eating a chef, a few days later she asked me if I could draw another, of a red spider-mite with an umbrella to explain the effect of the sun on red spider-mite (a pest on coffee), and again it was a hit. So… this lead to me getting more and more requests.\nI notice that my art could be useful not only to make fun of people but also to teach and educate, my peers and the public. Since then, I started to draw a combination of fun cartoons but also let’s call them… academic cartoons. I used them when I was lecturer at the University on my presentations, and the students really liked my style and even printed my cartoons for themselves. Then, for almost 5 years, I had a dark period and I stopped my art, even my vlogs. When I came to the Netherlands one day a student spotted me drawing, and again I was encouraged by her to continue with my passion for drawing. Since 2017, I haven’t stop, nowadays, 80% of my cartoons are banana related - an that is why I call them #bananatoons.\n\nIt seems your take on science communication, is multifaceted, using video (aka vlogs), drawn and text content to draw the readers attention. Why do you think #scicomm is so important and who is your target audience, currently?\nThis is a difficult question as I consider myself as a digital content creator, who also participates in SciComm, and indeed, SciComm is just a small portion of what I do as a digital creator. I like creating and if I dedicate just to SciComm I feel this would limit my creativity, and that is why I combine fun random content with my SciComm contributions. I recently started to pay more attention to Twitter but for several years I have been “teaching” among other things on Instagram, where I have my biggest audience. My target audience is, without a doubt, people without a scientific background. I try to make science easier for layman people. I use my cartoons, my videos, etc., to communicate or to simply teach new stuff, even cooking with bananas… My number one rule is: to be fun and visual. That is why I enjoy videos, drawings and photography. I miminse the amount of text, because most people don’t even read the posts they just react to images, and I’m okay with that because I also don’t have too much time to read.\nWhat advice do you have for early-career researchers or graduates, when it comes to creative walls or blocks? How do you overcome these and keep passionate about your work, both research and comics?\nTo explore, find their style and to be inspired by others. Everyone has something to teach you, be open to this.  Don’t limit yourself by surrounding yourself only with academics, particularly those with similar passions to yours. I prefer to be mixed into a community of academics,  artists, foodies, influencers, etc., people from different backgrounds, they help me see the world differently and create from their persective and for their enjoyment. People outside of academia already know how to reach thousands of people and “we” as academics can use their strategies to reach more people with our science. To keep inspired, from my personal experience, I would say: Try to enjoy your work, find a way to make it fun, even though I know sometimes is difficult. \n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nToday’s topic\nHello! this is our inaugural post for the #R4PlantPath blog post category.\nEvery week or so we will be sharing one piece of R code that (we hope!) you will find useful for analyzing or communicating plant pathology research and data more effectively and in a reproducible manner, using R.\n\nI will start with a technique that has been very useful, at least for me, and that many people usually make use of multiple software to prepare: the multi-panel plot figure.\nThis was the past me, not so many years ago. After learning how to produce plots in R, the next step was to combine them in an image editor software (sounds familiar to you?).\nThis approach works, of course, but it can be counterproductive every time the plot is updated (or a colleague requests a change) and the whole figure should be re-designed.\nIt can be even more complicated and laborious if the manual tweaking is extensive.\nIn brief, it is neither time-effective nor reproducible.\nMy multi-panel plotting game changed when I discovered the plot_grid function of the {cowplot} package (or in short, pkg).\nI used it until I discovered another game changer, the {patchwork} pkg.\nBoth packages are great options and it is really a matter of preference.\nI like the simplicity of the patchwork syntax.\nWho is this post for?\nI assume that you are an R (read RStudio and {tidyverse} here) user and are capable of producing a {ggplot2} object.\nI will focus mainly on the specifics of how to use the patchwork pkg to produce the most common type of figures and save them in the PNG format.\nPlease refer to several other good tutorials on the web on how to code using {tidyverse} and create great visualizations using ggplot.\nWould you like some coffee?\nUsing a plant pathology data set - Yay!\nNo iris or penguins allowed here!\nI may be biased (as coauthor of the paper) but the data set we are going to use is very rich to explore and demonstrate many ways to produce {ggplot2} figures and different analyses (we will look at these in future posts!).\nPlant disease data sets may be more interesting for plant pathologists than for other botanists, biologists and other scientists in general interested in playing with data sets for learning R.\nThe data set was gathered from a survey for one of the most important diseases globally, coffee leaf rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix.\nA large survey was conducted in Ethiopia to map the incidence and severity of the disease during one season.\nYou can head over to the paper for more details if you would like to understand the work at an advance level.\nThe data set is available online, in a github repo, as a csv file.\nWe will import the coffee leaf rust data into the R environment and store this as a data frame object named mycoffee.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nurl <-\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/paper-coffee-rust-Ethiopia/master/data/survey_clean.csv\" #this allows us to import the data from the online github repo\nmycoffee <-\n  read_csv(url) #and store it as a data frame object in our R environment\n\n\nSingle plots first\nIn the mycoffee data frame, there are two coffee rust-related variables (responses) of interest for our investigation, inc and sev2, incidence and severity, both are measured as a percentage; and there is a strong association between them.\n\n\ntheme_set(theme_light()) # for a global ggplot theme\n\np_cor <- mycoffee %>%\n  ggplot(aes(inc, sev2)) +\n  geom_point()\np_cor\n\n\n\nLet’s make two other plots, one for cultivar (factor variable) and other for altitude (numeric variable), relating each with inc.\nAs we did for the first plots, we need to assign each plot to a {ggplot2} object before we can produce the multi-panel figure.\n\n\np_cult <- mycoffee %>%\n  ggplot(aes(cultivar, inc)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\np_cult\n\n\n\n\n\np_alt <- mycoffee %>%\n  ggplot(aes(altitude, inc)) +\n  geom_point()\n\np_alt\n\n\n\nTwo-panel plot\nNow that we have the two {ggplot2} objects, we can use the {patchwork} pkg to produce a two-plot panel - the easiest way I’ve seen with the simplest layout, side by side.\n\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\np_cult | p_alt\n\n\n\nIs that it?\nYes!\nJust load the pkg and the | character will do the magic when connecting the two {ggplot2} objects.\nBut there is more, actually much more if you look at the documentation of the pkg\nLet’s keep exploring a few cool features for our nice coffee rust data set.\nNow we switch to the / character to see one plot on top of another.\n\n\np_cult / p_alt\n\n\n\nThree-panel plot\nWhat about a three-panel plot… can we also do this?\nYes, just follow the same logic.\n\n\np_cor /\n  (p_cult | p_alt)\n\n\n# try yourself:\n# p_cor | p_cult | p_alt \n\n\nPlot annotation\nFor scientific publishing, we need to refer to each plot by using a tag, usually using letters of the alphabet.\nThe plot_annotation function comes in handy to have the tag_levels defined.\n\n\np1 <- p_cult | p_alt\np1 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n# Try yourself these alternatives:\n# p1 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')\n\n\nIs the default font size too small?\nThis is no problem, we can customize the text size element of the theme.\n\n\np1 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A') &\n  theme(plot.tag = element_text(size = 20)) \n\n\n\nPlot layout\nBy default, each plot occupies the same space in the panel.\nSometimes we want them to occupy different spaces, right…\nThis can be handled using the plot_layout function and the width argument.\nLet’s say we want the scatter plot to be double the width of the boxplot.\nThe logic is similar when arranging the plots in a single column and two rows, but using the height argument.\n\n\np1 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") +\n  plot_layout(widths = c(0.5, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nwrap_elements(grid::textGrob('Text on top side')) + p1\n\n\n\nInset plots\nFinally, we want to display a large plot, but the other plot should be an inset of this one.\n\n\np_cor +\n  inset_element(\n    p_cult,\n    left = 0,\n    bottom = 0.4,\n    right = 0.4,\n    top = 1\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\")\n\n\n\nSaving the plots\nSaving is the same as with any {ggplot2} object, using the ggsave function and setting the width and height, as well as the dpi argument.\nEverything working, the PNG file should appear in the working directory.\nIf the figure is not at the desired size at first, I keep modifying the width and height, until you are happy with your visualization.\n\n\np2 <- p1 +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\")\n\nggsave(\n  filename = \"mymultipanel1.png\",\n  plot = p2,\n  width = 8,\n  height = 3,\n  dpi = 300\n)\n\n\nThat is it, we hope you find this useful, and of course these are very basic plots that can be heavily customized, but this is beyond my intent with this post, keep an eye our for future posts.\nHere is a list of suggested tutorials on patchwork.\nThe composer of plots - patchwork\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\n7 tips to combine multiple ggplots using patchwork\nPost-publication updates\nPlotting raster image (March 11 2021)\nFor the purpose of plotting raster images, I found that {cowplot} provides a neat solution.\nLet’s load an image using the draw_image() function of {cowplot} (which requires the {magick} pkg to work).\nWe will download an image of coffee leaf rust from the internet and create the clr_photo object.\n\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\nclr_photo <- ggdraw() +\n  draw_image(\n    \"https://emerycoffee.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/1024px-hemileia_vastatrix_-_coffee_leaf_rust.jpg\"\n  ) \n\n\nOK, now we can use it as any other object in patchwork.\n\n\n(p_cor | clr_photo) +\n  plot_layout(widths = c(0.5, 1))+\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\")\n\nggsave(\"mymultipanel2.png\", width = 10, height = 5)\n\n\nHere is the image as saved.\n\n\n\n\n",

Largely driven by the development of high-throughput, low cost, second generation sequencing methods, the industry has become familiar with Illumina as the most widely used sequencing platform for microbial genomics. However, it has become clear that short-read sequencing has significant limitations, in particular, the inability to fully reconstruct genomic structures of interest.\nOxford Nanopore Technologies offer a solution to this employing a single-molecule, long-read sequencing platform called minION often generating reads with a median length of 8-10kb and as long as 100kb. In-house sequencing can be a daunting task, even for those experienced in the process. In addition to this, fungi can be particularly difficult to prepare compared to other samples.\nThis talk will provide a beginner’s overview of Oxford Nanopore Technology and their platforms including the minION and flongle and what is required for a successful sequencing run. In particular, this seminar will focus on high molecular weight DNA extraction of fungi, quantification, purification, purity ratio checks, short read eliminators and library preparation using the Genomic DNA by Ligation sequencing kits. There will be an overview of costs as well as some tips and tricks to get the most out of your sequencing run.\n\n\n\n\n",

Powdery mildews are widespread obligate biotrophic fungal plant pathogens, comprising over 900 species that infect more than 10,000 plant species globally. The symptoms caused by these fungi are easy to spot, but the fungi themselves are difficult to handle, and some are difficult to identify. Many species cause economically important diseases of agricultural and horticultural crops; some have become invasive in different parts of the world, posing plant health biosecurity risks. In contrast to Eurasia and North America, powdery mildews are largely understudied in Australia. To address this knowledge gap in plant biosecurity diagnostics, a recent project produced an up-to-date list of all species that have been identified in Australia based on DNA barcode sequences. This was based on the precise identification of (i) specimens freshly collected from across the country; (ii) specimens preserved in plant pathology herbaria; and (iii) previously published DNA sequence data. The project confirmed the presence of 42 species in Australia. In Eurasia and North America, the number of powdery mildew species is much higher. Powdery mildew infections have been confirmed on only 13 native Australian plant species, and most of the causal agents were polyphagous that infect many other host plants both overseas and in Australia.\nAll powdery mildews infecting native plants in Australia were phylogenetically closely related to species known overseas. The data indicate that the Australian native vegetation may have evolved without being exposed to any powdery mildews until the 18th century, and most, if not all, species have been introduced since the European colonization of the continent.

However, in natural and agroecosystems, plants are frequently co-infected with several pathogen species or genotypes, exhibiting complexities not captured by the widely used single disease approach. In this seminar, I will address the complex dynamics of plant co-infection by focusing mainly on a tripartite pathosystem consisting of wheat as the host and two major fungal pathogens: Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) and Parastagonospora nodorum (Pan). These fungi commonly infect wheat leaves, causing yield loss by reducing leaf area available for photosynthesis. Symptoms caused by these fungi are very similar and often difficult to distinguish visually. Symptoms can also be misdiagnosed when unrelated wheat pathogens challenge conventional diagnosis. Results of field survey across WA wheatbelt showed that co-infection by Ptr and Pan is prevalent and likely to be commonplace. Furthermore, under controlled environment conditions, Ptr and Pan can complement the infection of co-inoculated leaves causing more rapid and extensive disease damage. This complementation is most evident in susceptible wheat cultivars and is highly influenced by the inoculation sequence of Ptr and Pan. Mechanisms governing this complementation are unclear but initial cytological evidence points towards an anatomical separation in leaf tissue occupied that may enable Ptr-Pan co-existence.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDr. Sally Mallowa, from Kenya, is an Assistant Professor of Biology at Augustana University (South Dakota, USA). Currently her focus is on science communication, advocacy and mentoring. Sally delivered a talk on, Technology driven cassava pest management on the 4th of May at the #OPPVirtualSeminars.\nOPP: How did you find your experience presenting for the OPP Virtual Seminar? Any advice to future virtual seminar presenters?\nIt was unusual to have no audience and not have the audience feedback to gauge participation and interest. During the virtual seminar you can see yourself and your presentation, this was unusual, make sure you get comfortable with this if this is something new to you. I found it to be a good motivator and challenge because the audience was much wider than only specific members of the cassava industry. Provide sufficient context and a balanced approach to the background information for a general audience. Avoid field-specific jargon or abbreviations, acronyms of diseases or institutions, this put this into. Practice a lot, maybe even more than you would normally.\nOPP: Could you explain a little how you got involved with cassava research and what is your current involvement?\nI am from a cassava growing village, yet was ignorant to the existing management efforts. Resistant varieties of cassava mosaic disease was not something we were exposed to in my village. During my master’s program at Egerton University, Njoro, Kenya. I realized that the research impacts were so much more than the paper I wrote. My trials were set up in Siaya County. I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in my village and wider community, seeing how our research changed the lives of those who helped maintain and harvest the trials. I was inspired that the trials were availing planting material to the community. This impact was the best reward.\nAs an early-career researcher, I was involved in proof of concept studies, confined field trial protocol development and pilot trials of Vircaplus, in Kenya, with one of the focuses on biofortification. Being part of an international multi-institutional project where medical doctors, nutritionists, breeders, plant pathologists, agronomists, molecular biologists and growers, opened my eyes to the benefits of collaboration. It was great to see where our project fitted into the bigger piece of the puzzle.\nMy doctorate research was on maize at Iowa State University. I also wrote a case study for undergraduates that stimulates students to think about the complex issues corn growers in the US Corn Belt face in deciding whether or not to use foliar fungicides. To translate the value of this case-study training to other pathosystems back in the field in Africa, I led a multi-institutional team that won the 2015 APS-Office of International Programs-Global Experience Award. We developed an undergraduate case study teaching resource on cassava brown streak virus disease (CBSD). This opportunity cuts across many relevant topics for undergraduate teaching - Africa, a staple crop, donor funding and research. I have been teaching a General Biology module and really seen this study open the eyes of the students (in East Africa and USA), exposing them to a different agricultural reality than their own.\nIn 2016 received a Next Generation Female Cassava Scientist, from GCP21 Global cassava partnership for the 21st century. That honor led me into advocacy, science communication outreach and mentoring.\nOPP: How did the first users of the smartphone technology react to the proposal of using Apps and web-based management tools? Like the PlantVillage NURU App.\nThe first users of PlantVillage Nuru were excited about this. Phones have changed the face of Africa, within our lifetimes, the last ~20 years. Older farmers might have challenges, but the younger growers are excited and think it is cool and they are very street smart. Local regulators, extension workers and farmer group leaders are trained and this is how these technologies are disseminated within and among communities.\nOPP: How do you see the seed-tracker changing the face of crop and disease management? The pilot seems successful, how will this be rolled out nationwide?\nFor us to have a seed system for vegetatively propagated crop, like Cassava Seed Tracker, is revolutionary. It sets up a framework on which to build other systems on. They might not be perfect but national programs see the possibility and opportunity in pockets of growing regions. Integrating growers, traders and consumers, informally people will get involved because growers build networks among themselves.\nOPP: The NextGen Cassava platform is one of the projects among many that is a multinational and multi-disciplinary project. The objective is to shorten breeding cycles and improve germplasm availability/access. Why do you feel it is important to have programs like these where local knowledge is considered in the research cycle?\nWe see often the technology is in one part of the world while the problems for which solutions are needed are in a different place. Collaborative research such as NextGen cassava has trained people to participate in using the most relevant breeding tools, infrastructure. It has invested heavily in training and building networks, so that in future years everything can be in the same space and local scientists can generate solutions that meet the needs of their population. This allows researchers to drive their own research agenda, which is where we want to be.\nOPP: You are very passionate about telling young people, juniors in primary and high school (~ages 7-18) about plant pathology?\nMy passion and excitement lie in where and who the change can come from in Agriculture. I came from a cassava growing community, it was something I ate. How did I not know at the time the extent of the disease problems and the effort into generating management programs. I realized that we need an education that transforms communities. We need to inspire the young people as early as primary school if we want them to grow into local leaders and farmers who will institute changes, it cannot be people from agencies or the city, or next country, they can guide and mentor.\nThinking long term is where we can make the greatest impact, this is part of developing the pipeline to feed change into communities. There are many existing programs, you do not need to start something new necessary, we can find ways to work together. Find your niche and work with an existing program, to build this pipeline.\nBe the change you want to see, science has given to us, how we can give back?\nOPP: I think that we can see why you are a Next Generation Researcher because you are reshaping the framework of how research is considered and how we can contribute to benefiting and honouring our own communities.

Since 2014 we identified cpn60 universal target (cpn60UT) as a suitable marker to identify and classify phytoplasmas, developing a friendly classification scheme supported by the 16S classification. We also went further on automating the use of cpn60UT to classify phytoplasmas through the online tool CpnClassiPhyR. Besides, we have been using cpn60UT to develop fast and accurate diagnostic tools to detect phytoplasmas affecting economically important crops. Here, I will summarize our findings related with the use of cpn60UT to detect, identify and characterize phytoplasmas.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDr. Gert Kema, from Wageningen University & Research (Wageningen), is the professor leading research at the Laboratory of Phytopathology. A focus on septoria tritici blotch of wheat for ~25 years set Gert on a path to work on banana as a result of the relationship between the causal fungi, Mycosphaerella graminicola, now known as Zymoseptoria tritici and Mycosphaerella fijiensis now known as Pseudocercospora fijiensis, associated with black sigatoka. Gert delivered a talk on, The ongoing pandemic of Tropical Race 4 threatens global banana production on the 30th of April at the #OPPVirtualSeminars.\nOPP: How did you find your experience presenting for the OPP Virtual Seminar?\nThis was the first time I interacted with the Open Plant Pathology platform. The opportunity came across my screen coincidentally when I saw Remco Stam was going to deliver a talk. I signed up immediately. During this crisis, we have modified our laboratory practices and have been making use of video conferencing for our student colloquiums and meetings. This makes me rather used too giving a virtual presentation. I enjoy sharing my research and I consider myself an experienced speaker, privileged to have had the opportunity to present at multiple international conferences previously. This reduced my hesitation to participate and encourage others to also part-take in the future.\nThe virtual seminars have been phenomenal for our student groups, we encourage their participation and we discuss them afterwards. These opportunities for students to get exposure to speakers and multiple topics they may not have had otherwise. Another great thing is the potential collaborations which can be built during this time. We can reach out to one another and build our networks. These have been some of the upsides of the crisis, it is always good to keep the positive aspects in mind in all situations.\nOPP: Any advice to future virtual seminar presenters?\nI think one of the things I could have done was to keep in mind the time zones, to perhaps conduct the talk in the afternoon, so that the South American community could have also joined in the live discussion. Luckily, they can access the YouTube recording. Perhaps, a balanced approach to scheduling to include those who work on the crop you are presenting on too.\nIt may seem strange to some, talking without a “traditional audience” but just trust that the audience is interested and paying attention, they did after all make the decision to spend their time listening to you.\nOPP: The dissemination of the Fusarium wilt disease-causing organisms is through water and contaminated soil and tools. What are your personal experiences with this and what is in place to prevent the spread?\nAn example of the power of water as a dispersal mechanism is in the Philippines during Typhoon Pablo, in 2012, much damage was caused and water was at the front of the disease spreading. However, water is not the primary or most impactful dispersal mode. The movement of contaminated tools and soil are what cause the most efficient spread of Fusarium wilt disease-causing organisms (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense and F. odoratissimum). On a visit to the Philippines, we walked through fields, not intentionally collecting samples under our soles, just walking in the fields. We could detect TR4 in the samples we collected from our shoes. Humans are vectors. This is clear in the intercontinental dissemination of the pathogens, illustrated for example by the forensic phylogenetics clearly showing the genetic similarity of TR4 strains we identified in the Philippines and Pakistan.\nMuch of the banana production is under smallholder production, a recently completed study indicated ~80% of the growers cannot recognise Fusarium wilt. The knowledge dissemination is limited on the farms. At a national level, there is much in place to ensure the spread is limited. On entering airports and farming districts, for example, there are banners communicating the risk and quarantine of Fusarium wilt. There are tire dips, disinfection stations and foot dips or mats to reduce the dissemination. However, killing Fusarium chlamydospores takes ~15-20 seconds exposure to disinfectants, and when in reality walking over the disinfection pads many do not spend this amount of time on the mat. Nevertheless, we have to conclude that in many farms the measures taken to prevent the entry of TR4 is not appropriate or even absent. Hence there is a lot to to understand with this pathogen and its host and to reach out to the producers and enable them to identify the pathogen to monitor at a disruptive scale so that swifter and accurate diagnoses can be made.\nOPP: Cavendish was the champion of managing Fusarium wilt. However, TR4 belonging to a single species, Fusarium odoratissimum, has shaken this. Why do you think research and development has not moved forward in the last century for banana like other crops, for example wheat?\nThe research spheres of wheat and banana are worlds apart. It is a complex comparison but I will explain a few reasons.\nIn the early years, wheat breeding was conducted in e.g. the Netherlands at Universities, but over time private companies have taken over. However, there is a lively public-private partnership between academia and breeding companies now.\nMany people are involved in the wheat research community, the volume of genes identified in wheat rust resistance, for example, is a clear indication of what a large network of researchers can achieve.\nThese two components are lacking in the banana research sphere. However, we are starting to see some changes. More people are taking an interest in banana and it is becoming more attractive. Like myself, when I started working on TR4 ~10 years ago, I needed to learn a lot from those more experienced. Despite the fact that new blood within a community is sometimes seen as a challenge, it is also a fact that new people bring new ideas that can boost progress.\nIn the past, banana production was dominated by multinationals, on the stock markets. Their crop management strategies were short-sighted and not always open to future required research and development. This is changing now too. For example, Chiquita is now a family-owned company, it is clear to see the strategy being followed is different from that of the past. They have joined our research to facilitate changes in pest management.\nOPP: I would like to ask a question from the audience on the 30th of April, “can we use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) now in banana to uncover more resistance genes?”\nYes, and this is an approach we are currently pursuing. Although TR4 is catapulting much of the research and development, we need to consider Black Sigatoka in our research too. There is not much hope if we are to develop a TR4 resistant cultivar but it has the same or greater susceptibility for Black Sigatoka. We need to take a combined approach with a broad vision. The genetic diversity of banana is phenomenal and is mostly untouched. Here is another difference between the ‘wheat and banana worlds’ - phenotyping. In order to score cereal rusts, you have plants grown for ~10 days, inoculated and after 2-3 weeks you can usually successfully score. Banana are inoculated at 3 months of age and scoring takes place 7-10 weeks after inoculation. But once you are set up the options are at least there to conduct this research.\nOPP: Re: A Cavendish wild relative, what is the likelihood of uncovering a similar crop wild relative for future management?\nYes, I think the potential is there, but keep in mind wild relatives of South East Asia and Indonesia may taste great, but they are not seedless and this is what the market desires. We need to engage in high-throughput genetics to speed up and unlock the genetic potential to manage large-scale banana production sustainably. Simultaneously, we need also to have a smallholder producer focused approach in generating our disease management strategies. An inspiring example of this is Simon Groot, the winner of the World Food Prize last year, with his company East-West Seed. This approach serves growers and is solution-driven, moving away from old fashioned monoculture, to provide accessible genetics to the public.\nOPP: We know pathogens spread, and Fusarium wilt DCOs have a history of “moving” on a large-scale. Many smallholder growers are impacted by this, there is research on protecting crop but how are producer livelihoods protected?\nWe need feet on the ground, the research needs to reach the smallholders. We need to increase the ability of producers to recognise the disease and report these incursions. Fortunately, there are many web-based technologies which broaden the audience, but despite this, the disease continues to spread. We need to identify the holes and close them. The information is in many languages, English, French, Spanish but we need more translations. We need to prevent the incursion of this pathogen into new areas and if this cannot be done we need to isolate areas and eradicate what is possible to reduce the spread.\nOPP: Currently, there is much research on the second genome, rhizosphere and microbiome of hosts and their defence strategies. Is this a potential way to disrupt soil borne inoculum and protect the crop?\nOur research group is also involved in collaborations for soil microbiome gene expression in the host to manipulate disease management. There are tools available to achieve this and there is a growing awareness to the contribution of the overall environment of crop production. But we have to realize that we cannot sustainably protect a susceptible crop. We should be aware that we do not step into the same trap as the past, continuing with Cavendish 2.0. We need another approach and should not maintain a global monoculture or invest in dead research. We need to stand on the shoulder of our predecessors and develop new vistas and new varieties, we should open the tap like seen in for example wheat breeding, and it should continue to flow.\nOPP: Much appreciation to Gert for sharing your research with us and contributing to growing the Open Plant Pathology experience.\nYou can go and watch Gert’s #OPPvirtualseminar on our official YouTube channel.

In our work, we investigate the F. verticillioides (Fv) strain 10027 which is an Italian isolate and it produces high amount of fumonisin B1. To understand better the genetic behind the high production of mycotoxins, we Illumina sequenced the Fv 10027 (Fv10027) strain and compared to other Fv strains from the same area and worldwide. Comparative analysis between the reference strain Fv7600 and Fv10027 showed that about 6% of the reads of Fv10027 did not map on Fv7600 genome. Pulsed field electrophoresis of Fv7600 and Fv10027 showed that Fv7600 has one mini-chromosome of ~350Kb while Fv10027 has two of length 1Mb and 750Kb. Next, we tried to identify specific features of these two mini-chromosomes and we found that these are enriched in secreted proteins and have an higher level of repetitiveness. Intriguingly, BLAST analysis showed that proteins codified by genes located at the mini-chromosomes have the best identity with F. oxysporum proteins while, as expected, the proteins from the core-chromosomes have as best match proteins from the Fv7600. Additionally, more than half of the proteins codified from Fv10027 mini-chromosomes have an homolog protein codified on a dispensable chromosome in F. oxysporum. Subsequent synonyms substitution analysis suggests that mini-chromosomes of F. verticillioides probably were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from F. oxysporum but rather originated before the split of the two species.\n\n\n\n\n",

Peter delivered a talk on, How the study of necrotrophic effectors advanced our understanding of the enigmatic PR-1 protein on the 20th of April at the #OPPVirtualSeminars.\nOPP: How did you find your experience presenting for the OPP Virtual Seminar? Have you done something similar in the past?\nNo, I haven’t done anything like this in the past. As an experience, I found it particularly interesting. I am comfortable giving talks to both small and large crowds and have done so at conferences around the world. One aspect of giving a face-to-face seminar is that you can gauge the reception of the presentation by observing the audience - and moderate “on the run” accordingly. Of course, this is something you can’t do in a virtual seminar so I must admit to finding that a little challenging for the initial part of the talk.\nAny advice to future virtual seminar presenters?\nBasically, be mindful of the point above - whilst there is no visible audience in front of you - they are listening!\nYou have been working on/with Parastagonospora nodorum for ~20 years, it seems a complex pathosystem. Not many people have the privilege of gaining such a wonderful knowledge and experience base. How have changes in science and research affected your approach to asking and answering questions associated with Septoria nodorum blotch? And how do you keep motivated through the challenges?\nMy motivation comes from wanting to understand the interaction (or indeed interplay) between this pathogen and the host. Whilst we initially thought this was going to be a very simple system, it has proven to have complex intricacies which have provided a pleasant challenge for dissecting it further. This was enabled through the sequencing of the P. nodorum genome, which at the time was a costly affair but a worthy cause indeed. Whilst such new approaches like genome sequencing won’t necessarily help in dissecting the biochemistry presented, sequencing plays a pivotal role in answering important questions regarding the origin and evolution of such important proteins.\nWhat was one of your biggest “surprises” or unexpected findings considering the Tox3 x PR1 (Snn3, dominant susceptible host) interactions or lack of interactions?\nThe biggest surprise to me was that the interaction does actually play a significant role in facilitating disease. I was always under the impression that although I was under no doubt that these proteins interacted, I thought that the reasons were perhaps historical. However, this isn’t so and that we have demonstrated that a strain of P. nodorum lacking Tox3 showed significantly reduced disease on wheat lines lacking Snn3 - meaning that the interaction of the protein with PR1 is consequential to the outcome of the interaction.\nWhat is one of the most challenging components of your laboratory work? And how do you resolve this?\nAs we are getting more towards the “pointy end” of understanding this protein interaction, it is without a doubt that the greatest challenge we face in dissecting this system further is the complexity and genetic intractability of the host. Wheat harbours a very complex hexaploid genome meaning that multiple copies of genes exist derived from its ancestors. We have now (somewhat belatedly) realised this and have moved to try and advance our understanding of this interaction in the Arabidopsis thaliana model system.\nWould the manipulation of the responses driving host selective toxins present an opportunity of disease management in potential breeding programs? If so, how? And with the current focus on defining what is “genetically modified” how does this impact the potential use?\nBecause of the pathogen’s reliance on exploiting dominant genes within the host, this disease is relatively manageable by removing the susceptibility genes through conventional breeding (or indeed CRISPR if required). The findings relating to PR1 are important as they provide much-needed information about an important defence protein that is likely to help in the innovation of the disease management approaches in other pathosystems. E.g. Can we overexpress the CAPE1 peptide under a pathogen-inducible promoter? Whilst a blue-sky thought, it’s important that we continue to think and test, outside of the box as we know it.\nYour research team seems like a relatively large and dynamic group working on various components of this study, biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics, for example. What are your team management approaches?\nComplementary skills within a group are critical. Much of the work I presented was heavily biochemistry focussed but we wouldn’t be where we are without the structural biologists. But other skills are also required, e.g. I am particularly interested in the question of which function for Tox3 came first, PR1 interaction or necrosis-inducing? To answer this will potentially require population genomics expertise. You need to tackle complex problems with multiple approaches - it’s that simple. Much of my group has skills I don’t, I very much believe in finding good people and letting them do what they do best.\nThank you so much Peter for taking the time to speak to me and to share your research on the function of PR1 proteins in Septoria nodorum blotch in wheat. I look forward to seeing your group grow and untangle the intricacies.\nYou can go and watch Peter’s #OPPvirtualseminar on our official YouTube channel.

After years of muddling through, there remained just one solution: Cavendish bananas. Their excelling natural resistance to the so-called Fusarium Race 1 strains, which killed Gros Michel, saved the industry. It turned them into an example of durable resistance for at least 70 years around the world, while growing in Race 1 infested soils. This boomed Cavendish production, which today covers 95% of the export trade and approximately 50% of the overall global banana production.\n\nThe risks of such a monoculture have for long been underestimated, despite the fact that another Fusarium strain affected Cavendish already in the 1960’s. This was the source of an epidemic that stayed for long under the radar. Until 2014, when this so-called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) strain was detected in Jordan, outside its endemic Southeast Asian environment. From thereon it rapidly disseminated to many other countries from Africa, to the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and recently to Latin America. Since TR4 also affect many other varieties, including major staple foods such as plantain, it also threatens food security. The Cavendish debacle is an example of fragile agriculture. This has to change and requires thorough analyses, and new initiatives to diversify the crop. In this talk I will review our understanding of the phylogeography of TR4, and discuss on the broad genetic potential of the crop for breeding as well as options for disease management to avoid a repetition of history.”\n\n\n\n",

However, in recent years it has emerged that some necrotrophic fungi facilitate disease through a strict gene-for-gene mechanism as observed in biotrophic pathogens. For the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum the basis of this host specific interaction is small cysteine-rich effector proteins secreted during infection (ToxA, Tox1 and Tox3). These effectors interact with specific dominant susceptibility genes in the host leading to a programmed cell death response and disease. However, whilst we now understand the requirement of these effector proteins for disease, their modes of action remain poorly understood. In this talk I will present our latest findings on dissecting the dual functionality of the Tox3 effector protein and how this has serendipitously advanced our understanding of the enigmatic host defence protein, PR-1.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nWe are happy to kick start a new blog section called OPP Research Compendia. We aim to encourage plant pathologists to engage in reproducible research practices by providing examples developed by the plant pathology community. Briefly, the importance of the research and the main steps of the workflow is summarized and links are provided to data, scripts and other research outcomes that help to understand, reproduce and communicate the research findings.\n Meet the researcher\nIn this inaugural post, we showcase a reproducible example of research conducted by Dr. Muhammad Mohsin Raza, a recent graduate from Iowa State who worked under the supervision of Dr. Leonor Leandro, describes his research, the tools he used and how to reproduce his work. His project is a wonderful narrative, and one of many ways to build a research compendium to encourage reproducibility of the analysis and communication of the findings. These efforts help us Plant Pathologists (interdisciplinary researchers at our core) shape the impact we have on society by the data we convert to information which can be implemented in reality.\n\n Disease on target\nSudden death syndrome (SDS) is a disease of significant economic importance to soybeans, especially in the United States where it is distributed across 23 of the 28 U.S. states producing soybean, and substantially affecting soybean yield. A recent study on the economic impacts of soybean diseases in the U.S. estimated that from 1996 to 2016, the country had suffered 6.75 billion dollars loss due to SDC. A key component for an effective management of SDS includes early and accurate detection in soybean fields. Traditional scouting methods, based on ground based visual assessments, are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive, hence, a more time and cost-effective alternative method for monitoring and quantifying the distribution of SDS in soybean fields is needed. With this in mind, we hypothesized that SDS can be detected before symptoms are observed visually in large soybean plots through high-resolution (3 m) satellite imagery. After 3 years of research, a paper titled “Exploring the Potential of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery for the Detection of Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome” was recently published as open access in the Remote Sensing Journal. The general research workflow, tools and outcomes are shown in the figure below:\n\n The data\nDownload the data: Figshare\nWe collected both ground truth and remote sensing data from a soybean field experiment conducted at Iowa State University’s Marsden Farm located in Boone County, Iowa. We chose this site because of a wide range of SDS foliar incidence since 2010. This site is thus representative of a field-level soybean production system which has the potential to develop SDS symptoms significant enough to ensure a successful monitoring campaign.\nThe ground truth data were obtained as foliar disease incidence, visually rated in-field. SDS is rated on the whole plant, to ensure accuracy and precision we conducted inter and intra-rater agreement tests, as a training exercise with experienced raters. PlanetScope (PS) satellite images were acquired from Planet Labs Inc, a private imaging company based in San Francisco, CA, USA. Planet Labs provides a free subscription to students and researchers working in academia. PS satellite provides 4-band images with red, green, blue (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3-m spatial resolution daily. Besides that, PS provided images are geo-rectified (i.e., processed to remove distortions caused by tilt and terrain), radiometrically and atmospherically corrected, and projected.\n The analytical approach\nDownload the scripts: Figshare\nFor classification, we used a Random Forest method, i.e., a powerful and robust machine learning algorithm. Random Forest works by generating dozens of decision trees and aggregating their results to make final predictions. We chose this method because it can handle massive, multidimensional data sets, and it is robust to multicollinearity and over-fitting. Additionally, Random Forest evaluates the predictive importance of input features, such as reflectance wavebands in our study, hence supporting feature selection for subsequent analysis.\nWe performed Random Forest classification using open source libraries in R randomForest and randomForestSRC and Python Scikit-learn. For mapping, we used ArcGIS Pro, the professional desktop GIS application from Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute based in Redland, CA, USA).\n Community impacts and contribution\nWe obtained promising results indicating that high-resolution satellite imagery and Random Forest algorithm have the potential to detect SDS in soybean fields even before visible foliar symptom onset, i.e. detection via manual scouting. This approach may facilitate large-scale monitoring of SDS (and possibly other economically important soybean diseases). This information is useful for guiding recommendations for site-specific management in current and future seasons.\nTo better communicate the overall approach and the findings, I used ArcGIS story map to build an interactive tour of the problem statement and the workflow of data collection, automated data processing and analysis for SDS detection. Story maps can be developed for free.\n Motivation for reproducible research\nI started my PhD with a passion for Epidemiology, Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). I was thrilled to learn Big Data analytics tools and explore their application in Plant Pathology. In this journey, my adviser and other lab members fully supported me, although it was a new research venture for our lab. Learning new skills are essential for personal development and for creating and achieving new goals. Plus, sharing these skills with others not only fosters vision in others but also deepens our knowledge and gives rise to new opportunities and collaborations.\nWhile reviewing the literature, I was always fascinated by the techniques and tools researchers used to collect and analyze data. However, their methods and analysis were irreproducible due to the lack of data and code sharing. I realized the need for reproducibility early during my PhD. I pledged to publicize my data and code so that others can also run and learn the tools I used for data analysis. Thus, along with writing my dissertation, I deposited all of my data and code in Iowa State University’s data repository on figshare. Thus, making all the components of data extraction from satellite images, training, tuning and testing Random Forest models and evaluating the quality of SDS predictions in soybean plots available for our (future) selves, research communities and the public.\nCommunication is a crucial component when describing scientific findings to the general public. I am enthusiastic about presenting my research in an interactive and visually enriched way so that the audience can understand it fully. Therefore, I presented my research as two extension videos and a story map so that the layperson can also know what I am doing and the importance thereof for society. I urge other students and researchers to also believe in reproducibility and make their data and code public so that we can see and learn the tools researchers are using.\nStory map\n\n\n\n\nSummary/links of the outcomes\nPhD Dissertation\nOriginal Article\nResearch compendium (data + scripts)\nArcGIS story map\nOutreach video 1 and video 2\n\nThis blog section is in the hope of providing encouragement and support to those who are apprehensive, starting to or already fostering (graduate) research to be conducted in reproducible research workflows.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDr. Remco Stam ([@EvoMPMI](https://twitter.com/EvoMPMI)), a principal investigator (PI) at Technical University of Munich (Germany), delivered a talk on, The diversity and molecular evolution of plant defence against pathogens in nature on the 6th of March at the #OPPVirtualSeminars.\nHow did you find your experience presenting for the OPP Virtual Seminar? Have you done something similar in the past?\nI found presenting very exciting, but also a little strange because you are not seeing an audience like you normally would. I love public speaking and I love what I do, so I love telling people about it. I enjoy the interaction at conferences and seeing people’s expressions and their body language, it tells you a lot about your talk and the delivery thereof. Virtually, you can not gauge the ‘mood of the room’ and you can not tell if people are distracted or on phones or making coffee… But, a positive is that you can judge from the questions asked and the feedback, that people did pay attention, and even more enjoyed the talk. I have given a virtual seminar before, with a department in Copenhagen, but there was a camera in the room with the audience, so there was some type of gauge for interactions and interest. I most definitely would give another talk in this format though.\nAny advice to future virtual seminar presenters?\nI would say my biggest piece of advice is - be yourself, like you always are. Keep true to yourself and present results you have confidence in, results you can validate with robust analyses. Some practical advice is to check your microphone and that you do not move away from your computer if you only have access to your computer’s internal microphone. You can also find a way to grab people’s attention, like a trigger, to bring them back to focusing on your presentation.\nHow do you decide which population genetic statistics (evolutionary parameters) to select at the beginning of your study?\nIt is key that you can include all the parameters, as this provides the best opportunity to understand the whole system, with a slightly different lens for each parameter and in different combinations thereof too. Once you have collected your samples, you are bound to your data. Therefore it is key to think about the questions you want to be answered properly before sampling. You can use composites of the parameters measured and make inferences from calculating statistics from one another. But you always require robust data. In our case, we realised that data on rare SNPs was not very reliable and some of the derived statistics would be over- or under-estimated. Then you need to make choices and find workarounds. As researchers we are also all limited by our budgets.\nYou have to make the best with what you have. You need to be clever in how you use the funds you are provided with to answer the most important questions. Ultimately, you need to select parameters which are going to enable you to do this. I read a lot of literature and my curiosity piqued. I was interested in attempting to “fill some of the gaps” of the literature related to population dynamics and how this relates to gene families.\nIf I understand the work correctly, a higher non-synonymous diversity is observed in some NLRs across all the groups, what implication does this hold?\nThis is the whole point of figuring out the NLRs. On the one hand, we wanted to understand the evolutionary pressures and diversification of the genes. This is very important in some aspects of resistance in host plants because these are thought to adapt to new pathogens. Whereas, on the other hand, some genes are conserved, where no polymorphisms are observed, and these can also be vital to resistance. This paradox is what we need to understand the mechanisms underlying the purified or diversified selection. It is important that we know how plants in nature are “selecting” genes to assure pathogen recognition. Hopefully, the long term application is to see how these findings can be re-framed for resistance breeding or identifying candidate genes.\nWhere many other researchers avoid outliers, it seems that outliers are important components of your research, I am making this assumption from additionally reading your preprint. Can you elaborate on this, perhaps with reference to the Fst indexes?\nEvolution is not static, there is a lot of noise. A mutation might not mean anything, we may only see the significance thereof in later generations or by comparing a pattern we observe. This is why the outliers are so important to us, especially when we want to infer results from our Fst values. Usually, genes which are the most conserved or diverse are found outside of the normal distribution. This is an indication that the mutation was not a random chance but one of a process of selection. Of course, we filter out errors of the data set prior to assuming the outliers are significant so that we can inspect them further. One of the terms you can look into if these concepts are new to you is ‘genetic drift’. We are interested in detecting if the loss of a gene was purely by chance or not.\nWhat is your approach to data analysis and analytical workflows?\nAs the PI, I do not prescribe a specific scripting language for our analyses. Everyone is free to do what they are comfortable with, as long as it works effectively. If you prefer Python over Perl, that is fine, I prefer Python and R, but it depends on your preference. We are standing on the shoulders of giants when it comes to selecting software. Gene sequencing and genome research has really advanced and taken a foothold over the last 20-years. We are an open community, where a lot of discussion and engagement is made to learn what are the best practices. Of course, there are risks, you need to keep level headed and make sure you share protocols and results you are confident in, that are validated. It is great to share and get your work out there. It is not only for your benefit and that people know you are reliable, but it is a platform where you can save people time, instead of struggling to put protocols in place that you have tried and tested.\nYou mentioned fieldwork in Peru and Chile, why is this an important component of your research? How do you manage your field trips, and keep your collaborations vibrant and fruitfully functioning?\nI am personally very interested in this, I think it is vital to go and collect samples from nature. I am really passionate about the evolution of resistance genes and the pathogen’s response. We need people with local know-how they not only provide useful facilities but are also fantastic resources to navigate the terrain and internal protocols to move isolates between our countries. We adhere to the Nagoya Protocol, purifying the isolates in the country of origin and then only may we bring the cultures back to Europe. Our field trials are usually a period of two weeks, although they are an adventure, it can be exhausting. We wake up before sunrise, with the sun on the horizon, we drive long hours to make sure we get the distances we need to cover for the spatial aspects of the study. It is usually only three of us on a field trip, driving in a 4 x 4 across the landscapes. This is also associated with logistics and finances, if we are more people in the car we will require additional transport and these costs. The next phase, that I would love to do in the future, is looking at the severity and incidence of these pathogens, [which] would require a larger team - this should be interesting logistics to negotiate and implement.\nYou mentioned, the potential need for plant physiologists to contribute further, how do you see this in the future?\nYes, in our studies we saw a lot of quantitative resistance. Where some plants exhibit a high level of infection but others do not display such strong responses to the pathogen. This means that there may be physiological processes involved, not just monogenic R-genes. We need to open up our research and reach out to people experienced outside our direct discipline. Sometimes in the field of Molecular Plant Pathology, as a community, we tend to overlook Plant Physiology. I think this is due to the influx of molecular work which can be done now, with such ease. All our fields have narrowed into niches, but I think our methods are converging and our data sets are becoming larger, providing an ideal situation to collaborate and interact more freely. This is what makes Plant Pathology so exciting for me, the interactions of disciplines and opportunities to learn.\nOPP: If you have to summarise your take away message in one sentence, how would you go about doing this?\nI want to understand factors that govern coevolution between plants and pathogens, drawn from natural systems and how this extends into epidemics in our agronomic fields. This research also extends into fungicide resistance, and the artificial pressure or anthropogenic pressure placed onto pathogens to evolve. This is also a project we are working on Alternaria of potato, this pathogen has become a huge issue in Germany. Our long term goal aims to relieve the pressure of overusing or the reliance on fungicides, I think this is the goal of many Plant Pathologists to ensure an integrated pest management program.\nThank you so much Remco for making the time to speak to me and to share your thoughts on coevolution and the underlying mechanisms. You were so patient and explained so clearly something which is outside my usual research ‘comfort zone’. I am excited to see where your research will take you.\nYou can go and watch Remco’s #OPPvirtualseminar on our official YouTube channel. You are also welcome to interact with us in our Slack Community on our #virtual-seminar channel. By clicking on this link you can request to join Open Plant Pathology on Slack.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe scientific conference promoted by the Brazilian Society of Plant Pathology (SBF) is the primary venue for local scientists to present their research data. Among the different ways of delivering scientific content and receiving feedback, poster presentation is tradition and central at meetings. They might provide the largest amount of the least biased (not by invitation) information on the current and future status of research in the field. Most commonly, summaries of work presented in a conference are based on the number of abstracts per subarea or number of results from a keyword-based search. I have played with text analysis in a recent research article and thought it could be useful to identify the most frequent research areas to be presented at the 51CBFito meeting. I also wanted to learn new coding and, of course, share what I’ve learned.\nSources of data\nI began looking for the data and found a PDF file with several pages in the preface and a list of poster titles organized by sessions. I was not succesful in extracting information from that file using pdftools package the way I would like to. I gave up using that source and asked the organizers if there was another format - different from a spreadsheet. They sent me a link to a webpage that mainly displays a two-column table with poster IDs and titles in Portuguese. This source worked much better and was a chance for me to learn about scraping (harvesting) data from webpages using the rvest package.\nTime to harvest\nIt was rather easy to follow the examples of codes on how to read data from a table in a webpage and store data in a list, which can to be converted to a dataframe.\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ncbfito <- read_html(\"http://cbfito2019.com.br/index.php?page=portugues\") %>%\n  html_table() %>%\n  map_dfr(`[`, c(\"ID\", \"Título\")) %>%\n  rename(\"title\" = \"Título\") # rename column name to English \n\nwrite_csv(cbfito, \"cbfito.csv\") # storing in csv file in case the URL breaks!\ncbfito <- read_csv(\"cbfito.csv\")\n\nnrow(cbfito) # diplay the total number of posters\n## [1] 706\nText analysis\nNow that I got the titles of 706 posters, a tidy approach was used to analyse the text. The unnest_tokens() function allows to extract all words and store them in a new variable.\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tidyr)\ncbfito_words <- cbfito %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, title)\nhead(cbfito_words)\n## # A tibble: 6 x 2\n##   ID     word       \n##   <chr>  <chr>      \n## 1 ID 381 screening  \n## 2 ID 381 da         \n## 3 ID 381 atividade  \n## 4 ID 381 antifúngica\n## 5 ID 381 in         \n## 6 ID 381 vitro\nThe dataframe contains the ID variable and a new one called word with the individual words. Let’s see if there is any numeric string. Rearranging data in the column by word variable is one solution.\ncbfito_words %>%\n  arrange(word) %>% \n  head(10)\n## # A tibble: 10 x 2\n##    ID     word \n##    <chr>  <chr>\n##  1 ID 263 1    \n##  2 ID 730 1    \n##  3 ID 791 1    \n##  4 ID 50  17   \n##  5 ID 249 19   \n##  6 ID 789 19   \n##  7 ID 53  2    \n##  8 ID 495 2004 \n##  9 ID 495 2014 \n## 10 ID 219 2016\nAs we can see above there are some integers that I want to remove together with the entire ID column.\ncbfito_words %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(word, \"[0-10000]\")) %>% \n  select(word)\n## # A tibble: 9,757 x 1\n##    word       \n##    <chr>      \n##  1 screening  \n##  2 da         \n##  3 atividade  \n##  4 antifúngica\n##  5 in         \n##  6 vitro      \n##  7 de         \n##  8 óleos      \n##  9 essenciais \n## 10 sobre      \n## # … with 9,747 more rows\nNow the dataframe is composed of a single column with all words in a different row. Let’s view the 20 most frequent words.\ncbfito_words %>%\n    count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% \n  head(20)\n## # A tibble: 20 x 2\n##    word               n\n##    <fct>          <int>\n##  1 de              1159\n##  2 em               263\n##  3 da               249\n##  4 do               214\n##  5 no               185\n##  6 e                167\n##  7 of               141\n##  8 in               129\n##  9 a                127\n## 10 controle         122\n## 11 na               102\n## 12 avaliação         70\n## 13 sementes          70\n## 14 soja              65\n## 15 com               64\n## 16 colletotrichum    60\n## 17 spp               55\n## 18 o                 54\n## 19 à                 53\n## 20 fungicidas        52\nThe most frequent words in a language are called stop words. There are several of those both in Portuguese and in English, which I do not want them to appear in the analysis as I am interested in the more technical terms. To eliminate them, we need to find a list of stopwords. I found a few lists and picked this one set from this website that contains the highest number of stop words in Portuguese.\nstopwords_pt <- read_csv(\n  file = \"http://www.labape.com.br/rprimi/ds/stopwords.txt\",\n  col_names = FALSE\n)\nnames(stopwords_pt) <- \"word\"\nAn easy way to remove all stopwords in both languages is using the anti_join function.\ncbfito_words2 <- cbfito_words %>%\n  anti_join(stopwords_pt) %>%\n  anti_join(stop_words) # this is a list of English stopwords from the tidytext pkg\nLet’s have another close look at the list of words and check if there are some field-specific words that I want to eliminate.\ncbfito_words2\n## # A tibble: 6,330 x 2\n##    ID     word         \n##    <chr>  <chr>        \n##  1 ID 381 screening    \n##  2 ID 381 atividade    \n##  3 ID 381 antifúngica  \n##  4 ID 381 vitro        \n##  5 ID 381 óleos        \n##  6 ID 381 essenciais   \n##  7 ID 381 sobre        \n##  8 ID 381 fitopatógenos\n##  9 ID 253 desempenho   \n## 10 ID 253 fungicidas   \n## # … with 6,320 more rows\nI went through the list and could find a few unwanted words that are not of relevance for this summary. I did it manually considering that I had “only” 2,000 words, but I went through only those cited at least twice. The filter function can be used to eliminate those words from the list of words.\nwords_freq <- cbfito_words2 %>%\n  filter(!word %in% c(\n    \"spp\", \"sp\", \"sob\", \"sobre\", \"pv\", \"uso\", \"diferentes\", \"estado\", \"sob\", \"brasil\", \"brazil\", \"doenças\",  \"desenvolvimento\", \"soybean\", \"pós\", \"contra\", \"identification\", \"diversity\", \"formas\", \"hosts\")) %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n))\n\nwords_freq\n## # A tibble: 2,136 x 2\n##    word               n\n##    <fct>          <int>\n##  1 controle         122\n##  2 avaliação         70\n##  3 sementes          70\n##  4 soja              65\n##  5 colletotrichum    60\n##  6 fungicidas        52\n##  7 fusarium          50\n##  8 vitro             49\n##  9 plantas           43\n## 10 milho             42\n## # … with 2,126 more rows\nVisualization\nThe barplot gives us an idea of the most common research interests based on the number of posters - assuming that one word is not repeated in the same poster title.\nwords_freq %>% \n  head(40) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(reorder(word, n), n))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_light()+\n  labs(y = \"Frequency\", x = \"\")\n\nUsing barplots we have serious limitation in space. Also, it does not make sense to show too many words with just a few occurrences, for the case of a barplot. A nice solution for more crowded data is to produce a wordcloud. In the code below I defined a maximum of 200 words that appeared at least twice to be shown in the plot.\nlibrary(wordcloud)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nwords_freq %>%\n  # filter(n > 5) %>%\n  with(wordcloud(word,\n    n,\n    scale = c(3.5, 0.4),\n    max.words = 200,\n    min.freq = 2,\n    random.order = FALSE,\n    rot.per = 0.40, colors=brewer.pal(8, \"Dark2\")))\n\nConclusion\nTo answer the original question, my analysis showed that most of the studies by Brazilian pathologists are focused on control methods by fungicides, host resistance or biological agentes (Trichoderma and Bacillus) both in the field and under in vitro conditions. The most studied crops are soybean, maize, common bean, cowpea and tomato and the most common diseases are caused by fungi (Colletotrichum, Fusarium) followed by nematodes (Meloidogyne) and viruses.\nText analysis is an interesting approach and could be expanded further to answer different questions should more information be available. For example, if each poster was associated with a specific session, that could be taken into account in the analysis. Maybe some kind of network analysis could be used to check which words tend to appear more frequently together (same study). For example, for which group of pathogen was identification more common. What are the most common control methods studied in soybean? are they the same for other crops? Trends in research over time could be identified should text data on presentations from previous conference be available.\n\n\n\n",

However, in nature plants also encounter a large variety of pathogens. Interestingly, in natural systems this seldom leads to epidemics. One possible reason for this is the high amount of genetic variation that can be found in natural plant populations. In my lab we combine population genetics, genomics and molecular biology to unravel such variation and understand the evolutionary pressures that shape it. We study the genetic diversity of pathogen defence associated genes in a wild tomato species, Solanum chilense as well as its natural pathogens. In this talk I will highlight why S. chilense is an excellent system to study defence related diversity and evolution and I will show examples of recent findings on NLR gene evolution and the diversity of defence responses observed in general.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDr. Susann Auer, a postdoc at Technische Universität Dresden (Dresden, Germany), delivered the first OPP Virtual Seminar on the 31st of March, entitled Molecular response of Clubroot infected plants to the endophytic fungus Acremonium alternatum. I had the privilege to get to know her and her work a little better. Dr. Auer is a passionate researcher, who shows care towards her students and is thoughtful in considering her fellow researchers.\n\nThe first discovery or description of Clubroot disease was in the 19th century. Why do you think it is so poorly understood to date? I can see, it is not a lack of trying because the group you belong alone has been doing this research for at least 10 years.\nYes, Clubroot or club root, depending on your training, was discovered in the 19th century. You can read more about it on our groups webpage. I think one of the most important things to know is that the causal organism of Clubroot disease, Plasmodiophora brassicae is neither a fungus nor an oomycete, it is a protist, with a biphasic life cycle. We know much more about Clubroot now than we did 15 years or so ago. I think it is still poorly understood because of a few reasons (know more).\nFunding is limited - reviewers of grants (and papers) often don’t grasp the importance and economic damage of that disease in Brassica crops.\nIt is a tricky pathogen to work with - the experiments take a long time, and you need a good understanding of the basic biology of the disease before you can design proper experiments.\nThere is a low number of research groups working with Clubroot currently compared to other diseases.\nThe first genome draft of one pathotype (of many) was only available in 2015, from another genome draft the original data are still not available.\nClubroot groups are often competing for first papers and do not collaborate as well as they probably could.\nLack of trained scientists in Clubroot disease - as far as I see it many Clubroot Principle Investigators are well in their 50s or older, and there are only few early career researchers working on this disease, this poses a challenge because we need to make sure knowledge can be transferred between these two groups.\nIn the last years Clubroot research was facilitated mainly by Canadian researchers that were equipped with public funds for clubroot research since rapeseed production is very important for their economy. Proper funding of well-thought out research accelerates knowledge and gives researchers the freedom and time they need to study specific aspects of the disease.\nOur group leader has studied the disease since her PhD and publishes a lot on Clubroot. She has collaborated with many groups in the past and continues to do this which definitely helped a lot as well - but our funds are limited. We are a small group, with only her and me (and the occasional student) working on Clubroot in the recent years. We now have a new postdoc, who started doing some work on Clubroot as well. As we know, when starting with a new lab group and a new disease (especially this challenging pathogen) you need to gain experience. However, we have industry projects that tackle small things - and here we often cannot publish our results, due to the nature of industry. Overall, companies see that Clubroot is a rising problem and start investing resources by funding small projects because they are desperate now. Many countries often still ignore this problem, in the EU there is no concerted effort yet to tackle this disease. I fear we will only receive good funding when it’s pretty much too late and the majority of Brassica fields are already infested.\nI think it is important to share with students that laboratory work is not always what you expect. What extraction protocol do you use for the RNA from roots? and how do you find its efficiency?\nI used various methods, reagents and kits, depending on the host plant. For Arabidopsis, I mostly use RNAzol (a liquid, not a kit), it usually gives good results. I recently started using Nucleozol which seems to work just as fine. Often, I harvest my plants, homogenize the tissue immediately and freeze it in RNAzol until I have the complete experimental set harvested. Only then do I start with the RNA extraction. This gives the best results in terms of reproducibility and RNA quality. For Brassica, which has more specialized compounds that negatively affect RNA extraction, I used the innuprep RNA kit from Jenaanalytik and my all-time favourite Qiagen RNA plant mini kit. The latter is pretty expensive though so I mostly stick with RNAzol.\nRegarding efficiency it is hard to say, no matter what set of samples we analyse the variation is always considerable even if the same amount of biomass is used. From my experience, I think this interference can come from many sources. One of the first causes is the extraction efficiency of the researcher with the use of liquid nitrogen or beads, the variation usually decreases when the researcher gains experience. Some of the major sources are due to the complexity of this pathogen and its interaction with the host.\nDue to the nature of this patho-system you are left with a mixed sample, the roots of the host, especially in the advanced stages of disease consist mainly of pathogenic tissue making it difficult to extract host material. Also, you never know the ratio of pathogen to plant in your tissue so a considerable amount of your extracted RNA could be pathogen RNA. So even if the quality and quantity of your whole RNA sample seems fine you could end up with a low amount of transcripts for your plant genes of interest. I think a student needs to also have an awareness of seemingly small but actually important things. The longer you store your samples in the freezer the less likely you are to have good quality RNA in the end.\nIn your opinion, why is it crucial to understand the mechanisms which underlie the response of the host to the pathogen at a molecular level for this specific pathosystem, and the Plasmodiophora x Acremonium interaction?\nSusann: We don’t really know much about the immediate molecular response of plants to two microbes that are applied simultaneously yet. Luckily an increasing amount of papers addresses interactions with 3 or more organisms at the same time now. These interaction studies are complex and can be difficult to analyse. Especially when applying a BCA we should know which pathways are employed that might lead to the reduction of symptoms and ultimately increase yields in the end. Without this knowledge, we are poking at things in the dark, which is wasteful to resources and unwise experimental design. For new studies, we need the molecular knowledge to make educated guesses on what makes sense to try to combat a disease.\nWhat statistical program are you using for your data analysis? If it is R, what packages do you find most useful?\nSusann: For my qPCR data analyses, I use an old Excel macro - known as the REST software tool which allows for several reference genes to be included when estimating gene expression. I currently don’t use R directly for my data analysis. For visualisation, I use online tools such as BoxplotR and others to make plots. R is something I have worked with in the past, but I have had to prioritise my time and weigh up the benefits for me in the season I am in now. Luckily I have colleagues who are experienced with R and use it on a daily basis. If I have a question or problem I just ask them for help.\nWe are in the IYPH2020, why do you think it is important to integrate biological control agents, like Acremonium, into IPM systems?\nSusann: Biocontrol agents are natural antagonists. They work because they coevolve with the pest organisms we try to combat. In this specific year of plant health, it is important to remember that we already have a lot of tools at our hands we could try out to combat Clubroot disease. In many countries people use BCAs that work well in their specific context, sometimes due to a lack of alternatives or no access to expensive chemicals. Studying the interaction of the host with a BCA equips us with the necessary knowledge needed to be able to apply more BCAs to detrimental diseases. The need for sustainable agriculture that does not harm the farmers applying pest control or the environment and diversity of species is likely the best long-term route. In the EU a lot of effective yet harmful substances are banned now so we need to investigate alternatives and we need to do it now.\nIn your Virtual Seminar you spoke of potential collaborations, can we have some details regarding this?\nWe currently collaborate with a group in Czech, that does the -omics analyses for us and with several industry partners. I would love to have a collaboration with people with experience in developing fungal species into biofertilizers or BCAs. I would also very much like to work with other fungal specialists that can help me sequence the species I investigate or provide bioinformatic knowledge.\nA huge thank you to Susann for making the time to deliver her Virtual presentation, answer my questions and meet with me on Zoom. It was an honour to share your work with the OPP community. We look forward to seeing how we can grow together.\nYou can go and watch Susann’s Virtual Seminar on our official YouTube channel.

We had a quick chat with Benjamin who further stressed why he believes the timing is perfect to start experiencing virtual talks in plant pathology, a trend that is spreading into other scientific communities.\n“At this moment, ‘everyone’ has time to go to seminars online as they do less research, at their laboratories or field-work, and hopefully less meetings. I thought Virtual Seminars were a great idea for a long time. It is kind of the open-access model of publishing just developed further. We have all these technologies around us but don’t really use it for more open science. Really all conferences should be live-streamed and recorded. OPP is an existing platform that is really easy to plug into. What I like about it is the free-for-all no selection approach. It is anti-elitist and more open”.\n\n\n\nWould you like to have a virtual @OpenPlantPath seminar series? Please RT.\n\n— The Tattooed Future Fellow (@schwessinger) March 16, 2020\n\n\nResults of a quick Twitter poll were quite encouraging. We then took less than a week to quickly brainstorm and put together a minimal structure, resources and workflow to operate a multiple platform the current model we adopted. In brief, 20 or 30-min scientific talks are proposed in advance, approved and advertised. Talks goes live (Zoom webinar model) followed by a 10-min question and answer session from the audience moderated by the host. A slack channel is created for further interaction. The video record of the talk is uploaded to our YouTube channel. The slides and any other supplemental materials are archived at our OSF project with a CC-By 4.0 licence and DOI.\nThe model was successfully implemented and advertised. After a couple days, four talks have been proposed! The OPP Virtual Seminars took off on March 31 2020 with Dr. [@SusannAuer](https://twitter.com/SusannAuer), a postdoc at Technische Universität Dresden (Dresden, Germany) giving our inaugural seminar on some aspects of her research on biocontrol of clubroot disease.\n\n\n\nVirtual Seminars are off to a great start! @SusannAuer opens the series this Tuesday (31 Mar) talking about #clubroot #acremonium Check the webpage for the conference link and details for next seminars by @smallowa @petersolomon99 https://t.co/IzLR5DEMpS pic.twitter.com/rsZCEew5qy\n\n— Open Plant Pathology (@OpenPlantPath) March 29, 2020\n\n\nWe chatted with Susan to learn from her experience with this first and to hopefully stimulate and provide advice for future speakers.\nOPP: How did you find your experience presenting for the OPP Virtual Seminar? Have you done something similar in the past?\nSusann: I enjoyed the experience of doing a webinar. What is a bit odd initially, is the lack of interaction with the viewers - I usually interact a lot with the audience. I was distracted midway because I wondered if people could see and hear me. I wasn’t aware though that my picture, in the YouTube video, would be on the top right corner, overlaying the small pictures I usually put there. If I had known, I would have placed them somewhere else, but I think it’s still fine. Just a tip for future presenters.\nI haven’t done anything similar before. I am now seeing a rising amount of these kinds of things being organized in different communities. That’s a very good thing. If it remains free of charge, it will allow a much wider audience such as researchers who are disabled, come from poorer countries, are without funding for travel or have family obligations to contribute with their valuable insights into the science we do.\nI like it very much and am grateful that I could take this opportunity. I have been a postdoc for some years now and currently prioritise teaching students. I am focusing a majority of my time to ensure they manage the practical work to the best of their ability, connecting the content they are taught to reality. I also want to create a positive learning environment where they can do the best in learning, to not only benefit their own CV’s but also contribute to society meaningfully. This means I don’t invest enough time in publishing my research. So this platform provided a good opportunity for me to let people know I still do science, even if it is at a very low rate currently.\nOPP: Any advice to future virtual seminar presenters?\nSusann: Make sure you have enough time to prepare your presentation. Honestly, I submitted my request to present and selected a date perhaps too soon, I was excited for the opportunity. I left myself with one and a half days to prepare and that was a bit short for me. Give your audience a good understanding and background info on what you are studying as you can use these webinars later for student teaching.\nThese presentations can also be used as resources for interested people that want a primer in a specific Plant Pathology topic. Work on your graphics and make them visually appealing. Redundancy is necessary for this kind of format I think. Sometimes, a little more text on the slides helps the viewers and you can stay focused on your topic. This might assist you when you feel you have gone a little off-topic, and your audience will still understand you. Oh, and take into account that the internet connection can be unstable at times so speak slowly, take breaks or repeat sentences you want the viewers to hear.\n\n\n\n",

The clubroot pathogen persists in soils in the form of durable resting spores which infect new crops every consecutive year. Integrated pest management with biocontrol agents could work against this disease. We study one potential antagonist against clubroot, the endophytic fungus Acremonium alternatum. This fungus colonizes plant tissues and shows a consistent partial control of clubroot symptoms. Colonized plants have a better survival rate and suffer less from clubroot symptoms. In this seminar I will present a few highlights of our research including recent insights from -omics approaches and classic plant pathogen interaction studies for this specific tripartite interaction.\n\n\n\n\n",

HeimUniversity of Florida, USA\nAngus J. CarnegieDepartment of Primary Industries - Forestry, Australia\nPablo J. Zarco-TejadaThe University of Melbourne, Australia\nIntroduction\nA critical component for enhancing productivity and quality of food and fiber is the ability to quickly detect and monitor plant diseases in order to prevent or minimize losses to agricultural and forest products (Mahlein 2016). The earlier (prior to or at first symptoms) the diseases can be detected, the lower the risk of control failure or their spread to disease-free areas (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2018). Novel farming methods and tools have been proposed as a way to more precisely (temporally and spatially) deploy agrochemicals at the right dosage to the right target, thus helping to reduce the negative impacts on the environment, but to also reduce the risk of inadvertently developing chemical-resistant strains in the pathogen population due to chemical overuse (Mahlein et al. 2018). Currently, site-specific and advanced farming techniques are increasingly available, and their implementation is necessary to reduce agricultural expansion into native ecosystems and ensure food safety and supply (Foley et al. 2011; Vogel 2017). In the context of pest and diseases, optimizing agricultural practices through the integrated use of remote sensing and plant pathology seems to be a worthwhile enterprise (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010). Remote sensing (i.e. retrieving information from objects without direct contact) has been a promising discipline since the 1980s and was envisioned to support efforts in agronomic management and in plant pathology, therefore advancing the remote detection of abiotic and biotic stress. Thirty years ago, Jackson (1986) stated that: “continued research at all levels, ground, aircraft, and satellite (goal 1), should build the foundation for a future global stress-detection system (goal 2) that would be readily available to all (goal 3)”. We split Jackson’s vision into three smaller goals in order to explore whether we have achieved the aims he sought three decades ago. We highlight challenges and potential solutions in the context of application of remote sensing in plant pathology.\nChallenges\nWe believe that a major barrier in interdisciplinary science, or more recently known as convergence science, is the complexity of tasks that are often required to solve vexing problems that have a societal component (National Science Foundation 2016). To facilitate the search for solutions, the integration of knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines plays a central role. A new scientific language is thus created by bringing together intellectually-diverse researchers, as collaboration across disciplines requires effective ways of communicating. Both remote sensing and plant pathology interface and depend upon knowledge from other disciplines such as plant physiology, ecology, agronomy, geography, natural conservation, physics, electronics, mathematics and computational sciences. This can be illustrated by several current efforts, reviewed by Mahlein (2016), to develop early - even pre-symptomatic - disease detection systems using different sensor technologies. Commonly, thermal, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors are applied to isolated pathosystems in controlled environments. As pathogen movement is now facilitated through human transportation systems on a global scale (Willis 2017), single-point, small-scale, data are no longer sufficient. More intercontinental and interdisciplinary efforts are needed to establish functional detection systems of large, preferably global, coverage.\nIn the context of large team efforts, people from different worlds (conceptually and technically speaking) will need to work hand-in-hand. However, the potentially narrow and discipline-specific focus within each scientific field bears potential for miscommunication of concepts across disciplines that could hamper an effective research foundation being laid. This may lead to inappropriate or ineffective use of the proposed methods and tools from each discipline. To illustrate this, Liebig’s Law of the Minimum defines ‘stress’, from an agricultural point-of-view, as a situation when plant growth and yield is mainly limited by a constrained resource (Grime 2010). Contrastingly, Harper (1977) defined stress, from an ecological perspective, as the variability in mortality and recruitment rates in plant populations. Concepts are developed and applied in context, and so how can we improve interdisciplinary communication and collaboration in such situations when concepts are defined and interpreted differently across disciplines?\nRemote sensing has been largely ‘oversold’ in the past. It was provocatively defined, 40 years ago, as ‘a solution looking for a problem’. In spite of the advances by those people who pioneered and bravely engaged in this crosstalk, not all of what had been anticipated has been actually incorporated into disease management systems. But successful examples of applicable image-based systems have been demonstrated recently for early detection of harmful field epidemics (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2018) and to quantify disease intensity based on image classification methods (Pethybridge and Nelson 2015). In fact, improved developments in sensor technology over recent years have made use of remote sensing techniques more easily available and affordable. For example, 20 years ago only large organizations could purchase very expensive equipment such as hyperspectral sensors, and almost exclusively for research purposes that justified the investment. In the current age of ‘digital revolution’ and ‘big data’ in agriculture and forestry, remote sensing tools, as well as artificial intelligence, have become more accessible and popular thanks to sensor miniaturization, hardware evolution, reduced costs and more simple operation protocols (Mahlein et al. 2018). Once the usefulness and practicality of such systems are proven and established by researchers, the potential is enormous to integrate them into operational disease management programs and help solve problems from scales varying from plants to landscapes, including disease detection and monitoring. However, continuing interdisciplinary research is needed to advance knowledge and improve our understanding of the subtle plant physiological changes caused by different pathogens. This information can be acquired from remote sensing data and is crucial to discriminate among biotic and abiotic stresses, an issue that remains unsolved and requires further exploration (Mahlein 2016; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2018). We support calls that research should continue to validate methods within and between pathosystems before the approach is offered to farmers as the next ‘silver bullet’. Such validations could be realized by using advanced, physically based approaches like radiative transfer modeling to explore the biological cause of plant stress responses through sensor data. The success of remote sensing-based detection systems should be evaluated in the context of the actual end-user demand, as well as economic and ecological aspects. Establishing feasible and affordable plant disease detection systems will also require the inclusion and understanding of practitioners and policy-maker needs.\nPotential solutions\nWhile we acknowledge numerous examples of effective interdisciplinary research solving major global issues challenges have been identified (Brown et al. 2015; Ledford 2015; Van Noorden 2015), pointing to areas that can be improved to develop practical solutions as new issues arise. An auspicious beginning is to encourage engagement and dialogue among researchers based on ethical principles that include respect and the ability to listen and ask questions freely (Brown et al. 2015). One expert should acknowledge that a collaborator, while an expert in her/his field, may be an amateur in the other field and not be able to follow discipline-specific jargon, and thus avoid any uncomfortable debate. Inclusive and open scientific communities, such as Open Plant Pathology, whose vision is “to foster a diverse community culture that values openness, transparency and reproducibility of scientific research data and methods” (https://openplantpathology.org/) is an example of a welcoming environment that is already contributing to enhance the dialogue and break existing barriers.\nTo value and recognize mutual efforts, researchers should consider investing time to learn some concepts and methods of the other discipline. Care is needed to ensure that the concepts are not misunderstood, methodologies are not oversimplified, and their effectiveness kept intact, whilst avoiding discipline-specific jargon. This requires all parties to be up-to-date with the relevant literature, which can also be achieved through open platforms or social media interactions. One should be able to expect a minimum level of common knowledge to start collaborating and working on problems that advance both fields of research. The level of detail of the required knowledge depends on the complexity of the research questions and may vary. Building such knowledge should not only depend on an individual’s self-learning ability but also by integrating remote sensing science into the curriculum of many natural and social science disciplines.\nConclusion\nWith growing environmental concerns due to increased pesticide use, the concurrent rise of new pathogens endangering global food production, and the complexities involved in solving some of these issues at global scales, there is a clear need to assimilate remote sensing methods and innovative technology in plant pathology. We discussed potential solutions to realize Jackson’s proposed vision in the late 80s (Jackson 1986). To foster continued research (goal 1) we suggest tackling the complex challenges faced by remote sensing experts and plant pathologists by promoting an open and transparent culture of collaboration and communication, which will potentially lead to advances in stress-detection systems (goal 2) across temporal and spatial scales. In order to make the interdisciplinary research readily and widely (goal 3), we must build trust and cultivate a culture of transparency and openness as this is a fundamental principle of science. Employers and funding bodies can help to achieve this vision by creating a space for interdisciplinary specialists to operate towards reaching their full potential. Funding, intellectual freedom and suitable positions should be provided in order to allow specialists with different cultural, social and educational backgrounds to combine their ideas, to pave new ways toward protecting our natural landscapes and food systems.\nReferences\nBrown RR, Deletic A, Wong THF (2015) Interdisciplinarity: how to catalyze collaboration.

Sharing code, scripts and data that make up your analysis with others such that they are able to easily reproduce your results can make it easy to obtain feedback and improve the quality of your work. There are an overwhelming number of modern approaches, and online platforms, which can be used to make research reproducible. This workshop will introduce participants to ways that R and related tools, such as RMarkdown, can be used in creating reproducible research outputs. These outputs could be internal reports that are generated at the click of a button and each time the data are updated; detailed research compendia to supplement your latest research manuscript sharing the code, data and analysis; or even the research manuscript itself! This workshop will help you improve your workflow in RStudio by using projects and keyboard shortcuts; managing figures and tables, which dynamically update; managing references and in-text citations; creating bibliographies and modifying bibliography styles. Participants will gain hands-on experience generating Microsoft Word, PDF, Markdown and HTML document outputs and become familiar using RMarkdown for reproducible research. Basic familiarity with R and RStudio is required.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIn our third OPP Interview we have the privilege to chat with two prestigious computational scientists, representatives of the field of archaeology, about their experiences on the use, tool development and promotion of reproducible research practices in science.\nProf. Jade Guedes (UC San Diego) [@JadeArchaeobot](https://twitter.com/JadeArchaeobot) makes use of computational models in her interdisciplinary research program that interfaces with agriculture - she focuses on the understanding of how humans were forced to change or introduce agricultural strategies to new environments in face of climatic and social change (of course we would add ourselves that, historically, some of those changes have been due to plant disease epidemics)!\n\nProf. Ben Marwick (University of Washington) [@benmarwick](https://twitter.com/benmarwick), an R enthusiast, is well known from writing reviews and methodological papers on reproducible research. He is the leading author of rrtools, an R package that automates creation and distribution of research compendia, allowing others to reproduce all analytic steps and results of the research.\nThis interview were proposed and prepared by a member of our leadership, Dr. Rene Heim, (postdoc at the University of Florida) and an early career interdisciplinary and enthusiastic plant scientist who focuses his work on the early detection of plant stresses, as a response to pathogens and other biotic/abiotic factors, using remote sensing and data analytical tools. \nYou both are representing two recent generations of archaeologists who deal with large amount of data and depend heavily on computational methods to advance your research. You are also seriously concerned about the value of using and creating open research methods in all scientific fields. Tell us a bit about your background and when it clicked for you that embarking in open research practices would be beneficial for your work. Are there challenges or resistances in your field that oppose a move towards openness and reproducibility?\nJade: I’m an archaeobotanist which means that I study the relationship between people and plants in the past, so I’d say I’m a mixture between a plant biologist and an archaeologist. For my PhD I became particularly interested in the impacts of climate change on plant distribution and started looking into some of the work carried out in ecological modelling for examining this type of relationship.\nNone of the plug and play models were exactly what I needed as I needed to project data back into the past so I realized then that I would have to try develop something of my own. I started off doing some of this work on a non-reproducible platform, ArcGIS which is popular among archaeologists for spatial data, but I was frustrated at the systems ability to a.) handle large weather files like the ones I needed for my research and b.) the inability to reproduce the same results in a short amount of time and describe this to reviewers.\nI was introduced to working in a reproducible platform by a co-author of mine who felt that I would be better served by coding the models I was working on in an open source and easily reproducible platform “R” and I’ve never looked back since. I’m not sure when exactly it clicked for me that open science was crucial, but I’ve always been drawn the higher level of integrity open science embodies. So much of our research is publicly funded and we owe it to everyone and to science to make sure others can reproduce our work.\nFor me, open science is also the most ethical way to carry out research. I was reminded of this the other day when watching a documentary about the startup Theranos in silicon valley, who basically managed to defraud millions of dollars from investors, partially because their technology was kept secret and people were unable to evaluate it.\n\nOpen science keeps us honest! Archaeology probably has the same challenges as many fields: people may feel they own data sets derived from sites they excavated. They also might feel proprietary about models and code and worry that they may be “scooped”.\n\nMostly though, I think that people are just unaware of what types of tools exist for open research or have not been trained to use these.\nThere is also the issue common to many fields that young academics are expected to publish in prestigious journals however these are often behind a paywall so our research is not being made available to the public. The current reward system in academia isn’t putting enough emphasis on the value of open access in promotion. \nBen: I am an Associate Professor of archaeology in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Washington. My research interests include human-environment adaptations during the Pleistocene in Southeast Asia and Australia. My colleagues and I work with stone artefacts, organic and geological remains to understand past human behaviours and their environmental contexts.\nMy awareness of the importance of doing reproducible research came pretty late – well after I’d finished my PhD and started working as a professor. I needed some time to acquire the necessary basic skills, and to build up the courage to work differently from my peers and senior colleagues, and to be able to tell them that there might be better ways to do research. Most of my reproducible practices are self-taught by adopting practices I’ve observed in elsewhere, such as ecology and biology.\nI found this work in other fields inspirational and highly motivating, and it helped me to imagine a bright future for archaeology where people worked openly and transparently. Reproducibility is important in my research because many important steps in our data analysis occur on our computers, but these steps are often not documented in a way that we can easily access, archive, and communicate with others.\nThe use of software operated by a point-and-click interface is the key problem here. By changing the key analytical tool to a scripting language such as R, we change the nature of our computational work from closed and ephemeral, to open, reusable, and enduring. This makes it a lot easier to show what we’ve done, why we think the results we present are correct, and enable us and others to reuse and extend our work. These are fundamental for the advancement of archaeology as a science, and with improved reproducibility in our research, we can advance science faster and more reliably.\nYour work integrates other disciplines, especially Jade’s. Based on your experience with your own and other disciplines, do we need an open science platform for every scientific discipline individually or should we use the opportunity to create joint platforms to move science as a whole towards openness and reproducibility? If so, would it be feasible to put such platforms in place and maintain them?\nJade: I would say that we don’t necessarily need a single platform as different disciplines can house data in a variety of different formats. The key is having people who know how to access read and populate the different types of open science platforms and making sure that these have wide usage across fields. Ben: I agree with Jade that having some options is good for the research community. Research communities tend to have specific technical needs and cultural norms, so I think it would be a challenging and a risky project to aim for a platform suitable for multiple communities. My view is that most communities already have basic solutions for open science platforms available to them, what needs more work are the incentives for community members to use them and value them, for example in hiring and promotion evaluations. The challenge is mostly cultural, rather than technological.\nYou are networking and conducting your research with scientists from countries in Asia and Oceania. Based on your experience, do you see any major differences or obstacles for the adoption of open research practices in those countries? Or are the challenges no different than in North America where your home institutions are based?\nJade: I work a lot in China and the challenges I see to open science there are the same as the ones I see here. Universities aren’t offering their students the opportunities to be trained on the platforms and tools associated with open science, particularly on the coding front. There is a generational aspect to this as the older faculty never learned to use these tools so have been unable to effectively transmit this practice.\n\nBen: Like Jade, I see difficulties that are typical of changing anything in large organizations. I also see a lot of change relating to the quantification of research, for example an institute I collaborate with in Vietnam has recently started encouraging its staff to publish in journals named on certain lists and with certain impact factors. This has motivated a few of my colleagues there to learn R because they can see that some of the articles published in those journals are using R for making plots and computing statistics. But this is tough because, as Jade notes, there are few opportunities to formally learn R, and most of the documentation and tutorials are in English.\nIt’s also the case that archaeology departments in some countries have more of a qualitative, art-history origin, so students and faculty are not expecting to do much quantitative work as archaeologists. Updating these expectations is a challenge. There are also infrastructure challenges, I’ve taught R to archaeologists in Myanmar where we had no Internet connection. This makes it hard for students to continue learning and trouble-shooting on their own.\nOne of my supervisors once said to me: “Why are you promoting open and reproducible research? Science was always meant to be that way.” What are the main reasons for transparency and reproducibility being a hot topic in science today? Is the current push towards open and transparent research just a trend due to technology development or is there a real crisis and need for it in science?\nJade: I do think that technology (online archiving, ability to upload supplementary information and share code) is making it easier for science to be reproducible but science was always meant to be that way. I think that the crisis is an old one, but with the availability of new tools it is becoming increasingly impossible to make excuses for not using them. Ben: The main reasons for transparency and reproducibility being widely discussed now are that some research communities have been badly burnt by a long-term accumulation of unreliable claims. Those fields are having their crisis moment, and others are looking on and wondering if this could happen in their field. This is due to a high degree of divergence between the ideals of science and the practice of science. The cause of this divergence may be due to the incentives that characterize a professional career in research.\nThese incentives rarely give recognition for working openly, transparently and reproducibility, and usually reward the opposite: working secretly, as quickly as possible, sharing minimally, to protect the potential for future high-impact publications. So long as these incentives remain encoded in the hiring and promotion policies of our institutions, we need to deliberately and explicitly advocate for counter-norms of reproducible research. I agree with Jade that is much easier to argue for open and transparent research now that the technological barriers have been greatly reduced.\nMany researchers express concern regarding making data publicly available before their work is finally published. Fear of scooping and other issues come into play here. In a recent look at 200 plant pathology articles (not yet published), more than 150 do not make data available in any form. Do you think it is necessary or advantageous to publish data before publishing a paper, at least in e-print form or final peer-reviewed journal format? How do you deal with this in your own research?\nJade: I think that at any rate the data should accompany the published paper and be placed in an open access repository so others can reproduce your finds/use your data for other studies. This is what keeps science moving forward! I’m not worried about being scooped as my interpretation or the types of questions I ask of data will always differ from someone else.\nI’ve personally placed my data online prior to publication in venues that are common in archaeology like tDAR. It is also useful to have the data online prior to publication, particularly when dealing with large data sets for the purposes of peer review. If the data set is too large or complex to be attached as supplementary information, it is essential that it is housed somewhere where reviewers can access and vet the data.\nBen: Jade’s response is exactly what I’d say also, and sums up my approach. I try to make data available to peer reviewers and with the final publication. Sometimes during the writing process also, via a GitHub repository. Some data I cannot share, for example locations of archaeological sites at risk of vandalism, or data that is sensitive to the indigenous groups I’m working with. We’re studying data availability in archaeology journals and also find pretty low rates. On a positive note, archaeologists are generally willing to share when contacted by email. But this is not sustainable at scale or long term \nMarcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences stated:\n“We have to change the culture within the research community so open science becomes the easy, accepted, and default path of least resistance.” In an envisioned future when we all have adopted an open science approach, what instances are evaluating if our open data is sound and our analysis valid? Open peer-reviews?\nJade: I think that open peer review is important because it would encourage fair and transparent peer review. Ideally, reviewers would try reproduce each study and be able to evaluate problems. I can see however, how open peer review (or by this I mean having your name attached to a review) can be tricky for early career scholars who might be worried about retaliation if peer review is not anonymous. Ben: I’m much more interested in open data than open peer review, and I expect that strong policies on open data will have a far greater effect than conducting peer review in the open. I have not seen compelling studies of open peer review improving the efficiency or quality of research in that same what that I have for open data. As Jade points out, anonymity protects less powerful reviewers from possible retribution by rejected authors. I’d also add that reviewer anonymity protects the social cohesion of research groups by allowing reviewers and authors to be more coy about their disagreements in public fora, such as at conferences.\nFrom my experience, many researchers refuse responsibility for their work after it has been published. But sometimes our work can be relevant to the general public. Do the FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) imply that we must ensure that our work is fully accessible to everyone?\nJade: I think that all academic work is relevant to the public and making it accessible to them is essential. They likely funded the research after all! Many places already mandate that published articles which are public ally funded are open access for instance the EU. We need to do much better on this front in the States with making sure that our work is easily accessible. Much of what is considered prestigious publication venues are still in places that are behind paywalls, so part of this shift will involve valuing different publication models which are primarily open access in nature. Universities need to start taking this seriously. Ben: Yes, Jade’s point about public funding and public goods is one I feel strongly about also. There is also an under-appreciated decolonizing aspect of ensuring public accessibility of research data. For archaeologists we are often working on the remains of cultures that we don’t belong to, and we take those items away and sometime never return them if they go into museum or research collections in our universities. These practices are sometimes at odds with stewardship responsibilities of the indigenous and local groups that we work with, and may have analogies to economic and political activities of Western colonizing nations.\nObviously returning the artefacts is necessary to acknowledge their proper ownership and stewardship, but that is not enough. Making available the data we have extracted from those specimens is also a necessary process in decolonizing archaeology to support participation from our indigenous and community collaborators. The FAIR data principles are important for an ethical and socially just practice of archaeological research.\nAs you may know, plant pathology is a relatively novel, interdisciplinary and applied discipline given the complexity of the interactions among plants, micro-organisms and the environment at various levels. This provides an opportunity for strengthening interactions and interfacing with researchers from several interrelated fields. The need to have people skilled in dealing with data analysis is increasing (from genome to landscape levels). This is further enhancing the opportunity for interdisciplinary talk and work. However, the desired skills are not always there or it is difficult to attract talented students to work with epidemics in plants, especially in applied work. We wonder if the same happens in Archaeology and how you overcome these challenges\nJade: The same is absolutely true in archaeology. The key is training! The key difficulty is making sure that students, but also mid or late career scholars get access to courses in reproducible software. Ben actually runs a number of workshops designed to get people familiar with “R” and other reproducible platforms at our annual archaeology meetings. I think that universities and university departments must commit to also offering these skills as part of MA and PhD programs as they are essential to work, not only within a given academic field, but also for allowing students to find jobs outside of their chosen field, which is becoming increasingly necessary with the state of the academic job market. Ben: Right, I agree with Jade that we have similar issues in archaeology. Jade and I, and others in archaeology have success in sharing our skills and values in the courses that we teach. But it takes a lot of negotiation and persuasion for a department to make a big change in their curriculum, such as a commitment to consistently teaching empirical research using reproducible principles across several courses and multiple faculty.\nInstitutional inertia is a powerful force. I’ve observed changes in teaching skills happening most rapidly when graduate students self-teach themselves about reproducibility, and then have a chance to teach a course or part of a course, or even an informal study group, and the new approaches propagate from there, outside of the regular curriculum structure. So I’m hopeful that with persistence, the advantages of working reproducibility, which include skills in tools that make it easier to work with researchers from interrelated fields, will become widely evident as they filter across from graduate students to tenured faculty. As this happens, and these adventurous graduate students are appointed to faculty positions, teaching students to work reproducibly will become a natural part of undergraduate and graduate training.\n\n\n\n",

Writing an R package is not difficult per se, but it can be intimidating for a first timer.\nWhy would you want to write an R package?\nWell, as @PhytophthoraLab says, if you have more than two functions, you have a package, plus it means you can get citations!\nYes, if you write a nice R package that people like and use and you have provided the proper information, it can (and should) lead to citations for you.\nBefore we proceed.\nI have made some basic assumptions here.\nYou are familiar enough with R to write your own functions.\nYou have RStudio installed.\nYou have read at least one of the next resources mentioned and/or intend to use them in addition to this brief blog post.\nYou intend to use GitHub to host your package’s code.\nResources\nRather than writing another lengthy blog post about how to create an R package, I’ll just point to some of the resources that are available to get you started and fill in what I see as some gaps.\nFirst, Hadley Wickham has written a book on this topic, “R Packages’’, which is free from his website or available from Amazon.\nThat book has everything you need to get started with writing an R package.\nSecond, I used Hilary Parker’s tutorial, “Writing an R package from scratch” when I wrote my first R package.\nI can recommend this one for getting started.\nBut if that’s not enough, Karl Broman has put together a fantastic primer where he even states that there is value in a diversity of resources, hence this blog post.\nThe aforementioned resources will help you get your package set up and working.\nI will not spend too much time covering the ground they cover already.\nRather, I will spend some time covering areas that I have found useful, but that they do not cover like CITATION files (and why you need one), setting up a {pkgdown} website or how to get a DOI for the package.\nGetting Started\nThe easiest way to get started is with RStudio and the {usethis} and {devtools} packages.\nTwo other packages that you will want to use are {available}, which you can\nuse to check the availability of your package name and {pkgdown} for building a documentation website for your package.\nIf you have not already installed these packages, install them now.\nThey can be installed as follows.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\",\n                   \"usethis\",\n                   \"available\",\n                   \"pkgdown\",\n                   \"goodpractice\"),\n                 dependencies = TRUE)\n\n\nNaming\nOnce you are set up and going, first things first.\nYou need a good name for your new package. Hadley offers his advice here: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html#naming.\nWhile there is no real consensus on naming R packages CRAN does offer a few guidelines that you need to follow.\n\nThe mandatory ‘Package’ field gives the name of the package. This should contain only (ASCII) letters, numbers and dot, have at least two characters and start with a letter and not end in a dot.\n\nAlso note, that the use of an underscore, “_”, is not allowed in package names.\nIt is best to keep it short and informative.\nOnce you have picked a good name, check that it is available and does not have any connotations you might want to convey using {available}, available::available(\"spiffypkgname\").\nPackage Structure\nThe easiest way to set up your package structure is to either use RStudio’s capability to make an R package when creating a new project (with your spiffy new package name) or use usethis::create_package(\"spiffypkgname\"), which will set up the directories you need go get started and add the skeleton of an R package for you to start filling in.\nWhat Goes Where?\nIf you check inside your working directory, you’ll see a file structure like this:\nspiffypkgname\n  | - DESCRIPTION\n  | - NAMESPACE\n  | - R/\n  | - man/\nThere, you’ve created an R package!\nThe DESCRIPTION holds the author information, a description of the package itself, and other information on what packages are necessary for yours to work (Imports).\nThere are specific rules about formatting in the DESCRIPTION file that must be followed. Hadley gives a good overview,\nhttp://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html, but I suggested that you see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file for a much more in-depth guide as well.\nMost of the time you will not need to edit the NAMESPACE file directly.\nThe {devtools} package provides tools that will help maintain that for you.\nThis file ensures that your package plays nice with the others in R.\nThe R subdirectory is where you put your R scripts.\nTypically these would be scripts of functions that you wish to share with others.\nThe man directory is where the help files are stored.\nOnce you start documenting the scripts in R, this will populate.\nDocumenting\nA properly documented package will make it much easier for the end user, which means it is more likely to be used.\nDocumenting your package is easiest done using {Roxygen2}.\nFor each function or data set that the end user can use you must document it.\nSee http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html for how to write the documentation.\nAs you start getting more advanced in your package development I would refer you to the official “Writing R Extensions” section on documenting your package, https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files.\nLicensing\nThere are several resources available for helping you pick a license.\nFor my packages I default to the MIT license, but you may chose to use the GPL 2 or 3 or some other license depending on your specific needs and goals.\nTo generate a license file, use usethis::use_mit_license().\n?usethis::use_mit_license() describes both how to use the function, but also gives a quick description\nof four popular licenses and when they might be used.\nTo generate your LICENSE file type usethis::use_mit_license(\"Your Name Here\").\nVignettes\nOf course you will want to give detailed information on how users can use your spiffy new package, right?\nThat’s where a vignette comes in. Vignettes are long-form documentation that describe how to use the functions in the package in greater detail than the help files or perhaps contain a use case for illustration.\nYou can set up a vignette that’s written using {RMarkdown} by typing usethis::use_vignette(\"spiffypkgname\"), which creates a vignette simply named “spiffypkgname”, corresponding to your package name and sets up a template for you to edit with your examples.\nExample Data\nIf you have example data that you wish to include in your package, you may do so.\nMost of the time you will want to use inst/exdata to include example files to show how to parse data using the package.\nSee Hadley’s book section on data for a thorough discussion on the different ways data can be incorporated and when you might wish to use them.\nCitation\nI did mention citations at the beginning. Ideally your package should be easy to cite when your users type citation(\"spiffypkgname\") they’ll get a nicely formatted example of how to cite your package.\nTo do this you need to create a CITATION file with no file extension in the inst subdirectory of your package.\nThe contents of the CITATION file should look something like what follows here.\nYou don’t need to change year or note, these are autofilled with the values taken from the first two lines.\nThe bibtype will always be “Manual” as well unless you have a paper associated with the R package.\nyear <- sub(\"-.*\", \"\", meta$Date)\nnote <- sprintf(\"R package version %s\", meta$Version)\n\nbibentry(bibtype = \"Manual\",\n         title = \"{spiffypkgname}: Spiffy Functions for Spiffy Scientists\",\n         author = c(person(\"Your\", \"Name\")),\n         year = year,\n         note = note,\n         DOI = \"DOI goes here\",\n         url = \"spiffypkgname website address goes here\")\nWait you say! I don’t have a DOI and I don’t know how to make a website!\nFear not, for if you are using GitHub you can easily get a DOI to put in that DOI field in your CITATION and DESCRIPTION files.\nAnd by using the {pkgdown} package you can easily create a website for your package that tells users about it.\nDOI\nGitHub has teamed up with Zenodo to offer DOIs to help make your package more citeable.\nHead over to the GitHub Guides and have a read over the Making Your Code Citeable.\nUsing OSF (Open Science Framework) is also an option but this does not offer DOIs for individual releases like Zenodo does, which will offer a project DOI and a newly minted DOI for each release, e.g. v1.0.0, v1.0.2, etc.\nWebsite\n{pkgdown} makes deploying a website a very simple exercise.\nIt takes your README file and your documentation (including your vignette) and creates a nicely organised website for users to browse and learn all about {spiffypkgname}.\nSimply use usethis::use_pkgdown() once you commit your changes to GitHub, in the repository settings, set the webpage to\n“master branch/docs folder” in the GitHub Pages section of the Settings.\nThe link will appear once it is set.\nCopy and paste that in the repository webpage field next to the title for your repository (use the “Edit” button\non the main page of your repository to fill this field in).\nOther Miscellaneous Items\nInsert the GitHub links for the repository and for users to file Issues into the DESCRIPTION file, usethis::use_github_links().\nUse {goodpractice} to help you find issues with your package’s code, goodpractice::gp().\nWrapping Up\nThis post was not meant to be all-inclusive.\nThere are plenty of other great resources for getting started with making your own R package.\nMy intention here was to specifically point out items that I think are useful for an academic that might be writing an R package for sharing with others and to highlight some of the newer tools that are now available for getting started.\nOf course you are free to join our Slack workgroup as well and ask questions.\nA few of us have experience with different types of R packages and are happy to offer support.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to mladencucak for his thoughtful comments and suggestions on this article.\n\n\n\n",

Dr. Kamoun is known for his prolific Tweeting but, also importantly, for his work with oomycetes #notafungus, effectors, genomics and evolution.\nProf. Kamoun is well recognized for his efforts to champion data sharing and other open science practices. Recently he was one of the leading scientists who founded Open Wheat Blast, an initiative with the main goal of providing genomic data and analysis related to wheat blast with open access. The collaborative efforts by several teams allowed to rapidly confirm the source of wheat blast in Bangladesh in early 2016. It is a great pleasure to have Prof. Kamoun as an OPP member and answering a few questions about open science. \nYou have a strong presence in social media, together with other prominent plant pathologists, advocating for more open and transparent science and data sharing. Tell us a bit about your background and when you realized that open science and data sharing were important to furthering science\nI think I have always been tuned to new technologies and tools. I’m also aware of the importance of science communication and networking. Therefore, it’s perhaps no surprise that I quickly became hooked to Twitter and related social media tools such asScoop.it. Twitter has become an integral part of my daily routine. I use it primarilyto broadcast, gather new information and interact with a wide range of people beyond my immediate colleagues. I love that incessant flow of information we get through Twitter. In some ways, I’m addicted to knowledge and social interactions, and Twitter is my drug.\n\n\nQ: What inspires you about your job? A: Knowledge and people. https://t.co/G9ztJsw8Jx\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) July 21, 2017\n\nI think I first became aware of the open science movement with the first open access journals. It must have been the PLOS journals around year 2000. The rationale for open science, notably transparency and accountability, seemed evident given that our objective as scientists is to produce robust reproducible science and share it with others. Later, I became interested in open science as applied to genome sequencing of emerging plant pathogens. I still feel that the plant pathology community is too slow in applying the tools of genomics to new plant disease outbreaks.Too little, too late. \nHow do you compare the overall field of plant pathology to others in relation to the level of adoption of open science practices? Is there any kind of formal education and training that graduate schools/advisors should be more proactive to educate the new generation of scientists, or is this a matter of individual efforts?\nI want to start by saying that OPP is an absolutely amazing initiative that stands out from the conservative stance of many of our plant pathologist colleagues. My experience is that plant pathologists tend to be too slow in embracing the cultural changes that are sweeping the biological sciences. For example, a few months ago I participated in a [workshop] (http://kamounlab.dreamhosters.com/storify/RFBellagio_storify.html) on response to new plant disease outbreaks and some participants argued against open science approaches. There was even opposition to the simple concept of sharing data and biomaterial with experts. Remarkably, our biomedical colleagues manage to do just fine.\n\n\nQ: What inspires you about your job? A: Knowledge and people. https://t.co/G9ztJsw8Jx\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) July 21, 2017\n\nAnother aspect that is directly relevant to the acceptance of open science is the issue of research evaluation. Many seem reluctant to embrace preprints because they think that this would not count towards their career progression. Thus, I would encourage everyone to look at the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), urge their institution to sign up and hold their colleagues to these standards of research evaluation. To sum up, yes, we need more education about open science in plant pathology. OPP fills a critical niche. \nYou are among several scientists who strongly voice against the current scholarly publishing practices. You have even refused to review and submit articles for some journals because of the publisher. What is your advice for young scientists who expect recognition publishing in Nature/Cell/Science (NCS) journals?\nIndeed, it’s well established that scientific publishing is broken at several levels. But the onus shouldn’t be on early career scientists to fix the system, although they can create momentum and enable cultural changes by lobbying for DORA principles, embracing preprints and various other open science initiatives. My advice to early career scientists is to be fully aware that publishing is important. This is our main currency in science. I’m not arguing against that. But to be a successful scientist, it is critical to have a full set of skills.\nI highly recommend checking the [list of competencies] (https://www.nationalpostdoc.org/page/CoreCompetencies) developed by the National Postdoc Association. If you have some weakness, such as writing, speaking, networking etc., you will struggle to have a fulfilling career unless you address them. Focusing on improving weaknesses is more important than strengths. Even in a great orchestra, you only hear the bad player. What saddens me the most is to see early career scientists become obsessed with publishing in glam mags, such as Science and Nature. It’s a total fallacy to believe that all you need is a paper in these journals for your career to be made.\n\n\nThe mentality that if I get a CNS paper my career is set is a false narrative these days for most progressive institutions\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) April 16, 2018\n\nOf course, a solid publication record is important but I have seen many prospective faculty candidates falter despite a publication list that includes these glamorous journals. I recall an interviewee for a faculty position who first-authored three (Yes. Three!) Science papers but couldn’t articulate a reasonable response to valid questions from the committee. Needless to say, that interviewee didn’t get the job.\nMy advice is spelled out here. Aim high. But be reasonable. Also, don’t lose the plot. Your job is to produce solid science that stands the test of time, not to squeeze through a wishy-washy paper through reviewers and editors. Trust me, the community knows. Flawed papers get scorned even on Twitter. Personally, I’m proud that I got my job as Senior Scientist at The Sainsbury Lab without any Science or Nature papers. At that time, I thought it said a lot about the institution and how they value their scientists. Finally, the current publishing ethos of my lab is described here. \n\n\nI was hired @TheSainsburyLab 10 yrs ago without CNS papers. I've been on many committees that turned down CNS authors…\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) July 5, 2017\n\n\nAs a part of your objections to the current publishing practices you strongly support preprints. What advice do you give for getting started with using preprints?\nPreprints are central to the open science philosophy. I really wish to see more preprints inbioRxiv from the plant path community. This is a tremendous way to get your work out there and share it with others much earlier than is traditionally the case [See ASAPBIO Preprint FAQ] (http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq). It also relieves the stress associated with waiting for reviews and the tedious revision process. After all, the paper is already out there, so what if the final version takes a few more weeks. It’s liberating to post a preprint just when you finish writing up the paper.\nMy main advice is to treat the preprint like a regular paper and not to post premature, unpolished drafts. Some may think that it doesn’t matter but you will be judged, even subconsciously, by readers who are the colleagues who will formally review your papers and grants. You wouldn’t want to display a scrappy poster or give a messy talk at a conference.\n\n\nMy take is that it depends on the discovery. The way to see it is that preprints are part of a continuum from poster to talks to formal papers evaluated by peers. One could also ask whether a poster or talk would constitute priority…\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) October 31, 2018\n\nTo early career scientists, who may not feel confident to post a preprint, do seek input from your mentors, colleagues or even use scientific writing services to improve the draft. My sense is that the younger generation is puzzled by the traditional protracted process of science publishing and [the costs] (https://twitter.com/KamounLab/status/1009718491832872960) associated with it. Preprints are becoming routine in the biological sciences and [the growth of bioRxiv] (http://www.prepubmed.org/monthly_stats/) has been phenomenal. More concrete actions, such as accepting preprints in promotion packages, grant and fellowship applications are accelerating the process. All it would take now is for funding bodies to mandate preprints, which they really should if they truly believe in their open science manifesto. \nWhat do you see as the most significant outcome from your work as a result of using open science practices?\nOne amazing anecdote is that when we went public with the [sequences from the wheat blast] (http://wheatblast.net/) outbreak in Bangladesh], there was only one (ONE!) genome sequence available of a wheat blast isolate. Obviously, we couldn’t do much in interpreting the Bangladeshi sequences based on a single genome. However, it turned out that several labs had unpublished genome sequences of wheat blast isolates sitting in their computers. Within days, there was over 20 genome sequences available. That goes to show the importance of sharing data and also coming up with processes where depositing data sets is recognized as a scholarly contribution just like any other activity.\nAnother aspect that I found enlightening was the poorly appreciated process of live peer-review. This is what happens when you crowdsource analyses, and more than one group gets involved. You get instant validation! In the case of the wheat blast outbreak, we had two independent analyses performed by Daniel Croll in Zurich and [Pierre Gladieux] (http://s620715531.websitehome.co.uk/owb/phylogenomic-analyses-reveal-that-the-2016-outbreak-of-wheat-blast-in-bangladesh-is-caused-by-a-south-american-wheat-infecting-lineage-of-magnaporthe-oryzae/) in Montpellier. They both reached the exact same conclusion that the Bangladeshi strains originated from South America. A great example especially given discussions about the reproducibility crisis.\nFinally, the Open Plant Pathology community welcomes not only pathologists, but anyone who works in the field and wish to stay connected with other researchers to learn and share knowledge and contribute to promote open science and reproducible research. Surely, it does not fit everyone’s needs given the focus of OPP on more computational aspects and use of free open source software (FOSS). What are the areas and target audience that you think might benefit most from participating and taking leadership in this community?\nSK: Open science can impact several areas of plant pathology beyond computational biology. One example would be the reporting of new disease outbreaks and the first response to these outbreaks. Think of how basic the ProMED-mail platform is. I think this is the only centralized online platform that rapidly reports new plant disease outbreaks. We should have something akin to a global extension platform with plant pathologists openly contributing advice and analyses on how to respond to these outbreaks. It’s shocking to me that the most common word on ProMED-mail is “undiagnosed”.\n\n\nI was hired @TheSainsburyLab 10 yrs ago without CNS papers. I've been on many committees that turned down CNS authors…\n\n— Sophien Kamoun (@KamounLab) July 5, 2017\n\nI also hope we can reach out more to developing countries and educate scientists about the value of open science. I recommend you interview my colleagueTofazzal Islam, who became a champion of open science following our collaboration on the Bangladeshi wheat blast outbreak. That experience was revealing to me too. It showed the power of open science to help build wide-reaching connections and networks that wouldn’t otherwise readily happen.\nOn a related topic, one of the challenges for scientists in developing countries is to produce full-length publications. Open science tools allow intermediate reports to be published for example through platforms like figshare, zenodo etc. These can be viewed as credited mini-publications. It’s a great opportunity for students and scientists in developing countries to communicate their science in increments without the challenge of producing a typical scientific paper.\nAt the end, the main challenge is education. The standard system of publication and incentives is so ingrained in the current culture that it is challenging to deliver the necessary changes. We should embrace any opportunity to educate plant pathologists about open science no matter the audience, and no matter the platform.\nOther relevant links:\nhttp://kamounlab.tumblr.com/post/176385835530/the-edge-of-tomorrow-plant-health-in-the-21st\nhttp://kamounlab.tumblr.com/post/178573217080/point-of-view-wither-pre-publication-peer-review\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOur first OPP interview features Dr. Niklaus Grünwald [@PhytophthoraLab on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhytophthoraLab), a plant pathologist with USDA ARS, Corvallis, OR, USA. Nik is well recognized by his research on population genetics and genomics of plant pathogens - mainly on oomycetes of major importance to global agriculture. The Grünwald Lab has made significant scientific contributions to the understanding of the population biology and evolution of Phytophthora infestans worldwide.\n\nMore recently, his students have developed R packages which have contributed considerably to advance and facilitate the analysis of genetic and genome sequence data with applications in taxonomy and evolution, beyond the field of plant pathology. Members of the Grünwald Lab has offered workshops on reproducible research and the analysis of genomic data during the APS meetings using those packages. It is our great pleasure to have Nik answering six questions that we prepared for him. \nTell us about your background, especially when you realized that programming skills were important and which were the languages/software used at that time and for what purpose?\nI have used programming as a tool on and off since my undergraduate days. In fact I used to earn pocket money as a programmer. As an econ undergrad major I learned Pascal as my first language. During my PhD I programmed extensively in SAS. As a postdoc I wanted to calculate genotypic diversity indices and could not do it in SAS so I programmed some routines in C to enable calculation of rarefaction as well as for speed.\nWhen and why did you decide to stop using commercial software and embrace open source software for the development of tools to analyse molecular data in the context of population biology of plant pathogens?\nAbout 8 years ago my lab switched from SAS to using R. I am absolutely loving R because of the open source (and free) nature, the ability to produce publication ready graphs, tools for reproducibility, and the fact that many members of the R community contribute packages. The fact that R is open is important because you can actually see the raw code and find mistakes and contribute new functions. SAS procedures are closed. We switched once we could do everything in R that I used to do in SAS. I also love R because it is free. When you have several postdocs and graduate students in the lab, subscriptions to software become very expensive. Another reason I love R is that we can create electronic lab notebooks using R Markdown that allow for better, albeit not perfect, reproducibility.\nStudents are mainly driven by scientific publications in top journals as main, mostly only, outcome of their research. Students of the Grünwald Lab are developing new tools that help to process, analyze and visualize genetic/genomic data as part of the dissertation. This is quite unconventional, in the field of plant pathology at least. Is there a reason for this change? What are the benefits and challenges, for both student and advisor, from investing in the development of tools and not keeping up only with the more conventional hypothesis-driven graduate research?\nMy way of approaching this is that graduate students should be trained in hypothesis-driven biological research. Interviewing for a faculty position or promotion and tenure rely on the perceived impact of their fundamental biological research. However, while conducting this research we often find ourselves developing custom scripts in ecology, genetics or genomics. If these scripts can be used by other colleagues we release these as a package in R (Fig. 1). We have done this so far with the R packages poppr, vcfR, metacodeR, taxa, effectr, and popprxl. This sometimes results in an extra publication (eg: MetacodeR and vcfR) with a modest amount of additional effort. Methods papers releasing R packages are highly cited; thus, computational biology resources contribute significantly to the citations and the impact of a scientist. But I caution students and postdocs not to rely solely on computational papers since biology papers will remain the bread and butter for recognition and impact of our work.\n\nYou have been quite active on social media advocating for more open and transparent science and data and code sharing. As leader of the publication board of the American Phytopathological Society (APS) journals, a new article type that fits any of the APS journals called Resource Announcement, have been created. I wonder how you came up with this idea and what are the expectations for this kind of publication.*\nLarge data sets, like genome sequences, microbiome or imaging data, are wonderful resources for all of us if they are available with the proper metadata and copyright. The Resource Announcement we created for APS journals as a new category provides a venue for getting citations and credit for these types of efforts. We want to incentivize release of data, code and related resources so that it can be reused. Several journals are doing this now including mBio and Molecular Ecology Resources. With the new category of Resource Announcement (Fig. 2), we are keeping plant pathology resources within the ecosystem of APS journals.\n\nAs you know, OPP is for everyone who wants to 1) stay connected with other researchers with interest/developments in the field of plant pathology and 2) contribute to promote open science and reproducible research. It may not fit everyone’s needs given the focus of #OPP on more computational aspects using open source software. What are the areas and target audience that you think shall benefit most from participating and taking leadership in this new community?\nI think every plant pathologist benefits from following the #OPP philosophy of sharing data, code and resources openly and following principles of reproducible research. In the US, the federal government requires open access to publications, data, code and related resources from federally funded grants. Major donors like the Welcome Trust or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation similarly require open approaches. #OPP provides a network and resources for training that benefit all of us in doing open research. I think the fundamental role that #OPP is playing is to incentivize open, transparent and reproducible research. Not everybody needs to be a hardcore coder, but basic coding including reproducible lab notebooks help reproducibility and benefits all of us. Given organizations like Retraction Watch, PubPeer, and others that monitor reproducibility and rigor in science, it is incumbent upon all of to us to keep good records so that we can correct mistakes in the literature when they are identified. #OPP facilitates this process and helps all of us learn from each other to become better open scientists.\nFor the prospective students who want to join the Grünwald Lab, what is the word of encouragement and necessary skills for those willing to pursue a PhD in the exciting field of population genetics and genomics?\nYou do not need to be a programmer if you want to work in my lab. However, you should not be afraid of using computational tools to ask biological questions. Today’s biology is highly quantitative and I do not see this changing anytime soon. Molecular biology when I went to grad school was not quantitative. In the era of high throughput sequencing the fields of genetics and genomics have adopted highly sophisticated computational and statistical approaches.\nThanks Nik!

As the availability of data increases at scales from genomes to landscapes, our approaches now require even more diverse skills to collaborate and advance the field. Reproducible research and open science practices are chief among these, however, relatively few examples in plant pathology exist. To support the adoption of these practices, we founded the Open Plant Pathology community (https://openplantpathology.org), which aims to foster relationships between researchers and promote open, transparent and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software, using R.

    "contents": "\nslides | code\nBotanical epidemiologists have long been leaders in using mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to tackle theoretical and applied research problems. Such skills always distinguished us from other plant pathology disciplines and naturally allowed us to bring together quantitative researchers (e.g. mathematicians, statisticians, programmers), which has been beneficial to our area of research.\n\nThe availability of increasing amounts of data at scales from genomes to landscapes requires an even more diverse set of skills and enhanced ability to interact widely and advance the field. Additionally, donors, governments and journals are pushing for increased transparency and reproducibility (Bond-Lamberty et al. 2016). Because of this an open approach to science is quickly becoming more accepted, including unconstrained access and sharing of scientific content, data collection and computer code.\nIt is envisioned that fostering open science attitudes within our research communities will lead to improved reproducibility of the research, both in relation to the methods and the findings. Adopting reproducible research practices directly benefits us as researchers. Between complicated analyses, reviews and revisions and questions years later about the data that was collected or analysis that was conducted, it’s extremely beneficial to be able to easily reproduce your work quickly and easily.\nSecond, it is beneficial to the end-user or reader to be able to verify the validity of the methods used and recreate the analysis which helps with knowledge transfer. Lastly, sharing work openly and making it discoverable can lead to collaborations. While relatively few examples of reproducible research in plant pathology exist (Shah and Madden 2004), it is changing (Del Ponte 2018, Duku et al. 2015, Sparks et al. 2018). To help facilitate this change, we founded the Open Plant Pathology community (Del Ponte and Sparks 2018), which aims to foster relationships between researchers and promote open, transparent and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. With our history of moving plant pathology forward using computational resources, botanical epidemiologists should be in front leading the way for plant pathology with these new methods.\n\n\n\n",

I like to use the tabyl() function of the {janitor} package as substitute for table(), so you can do the same using the latter base function if you prefer.\n    library(janitor)\n\n    ## \n    ## Attaching package: 'janitor'\n\n    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n    ## \n    ##     chisq.test, fisher.test\n\n    fungicide %>%\n      tabyl(active_ingredient) %>%\n      arrange(-n)\n\n    ##   active_ingredient   n    percent\n    ## 1             check 250 0.17385257\n    ## 2              tebu 248 0.17246175\n    ## 3         azox_cypr 212 0.14742698\n    ## 4         pyra_epox 154 0.10709318\n    ## 5              cypr 146 0.10152990\n    ## 6         pico_cypr 144 0.10013908\n    ## 7         trif_prot 109 0.07579972\n    ## 8         pyra_metc  96 0.06675939\n    ## 9              azox  79 0.05493741\nAnd now we can make a pivot table for active ingredient versus year to check those used for longer time and lower gaps.\nThe values represent the number of trials where the fungicide was evaluated within a specific year.\n    fungicide %>%\n      tabyl(active_ingredient, year) %>%\n      arrange(active_ingredient)\n\n    ##   active_ingredient 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n    ## 1              azox    0    0   19    0    0    0    0   17   23   20\n    ## 2         azox_cypr   19    0   20   11   53   28   21   17   23   20\n    ## 3             check   19   19   39   11   53   28   21   17   23   20\n    ## 4              cypr    0   18   19    0    0   28   21   17   23   20\n    ## 5         pico_cypr    0    0    0   11   25   28   21   17   22   20\n    ## 6         pyra_epox    0    0   20    0   25   28   21   17   23   20\n    ## 7         pyra_metc    0    0    0    0   28   27   21    0    0   20\n    ## 8              tebu   19   19   37   11   53   28   21   17   23   20\n    ## 9         trif_prot    0    0    0    0   28    0   21   17   23   20\nBesides the non-treated check with the largest sample size (250 independent experiments), the fungicides evaluated in most years were tebu and azox+cypro, or eight years (2007 to 2014).\nWe will need the check treatment as well.\nI like to subset the data using the filter() function so we keep only the relevant data to work further.\nData preparation\n    tebu_mix <- fungicide %>%\n      filter(active_ingredient %in% c(\"check\", \"tebu\", \"azox_cypr\")) %>%\n      arrange(trial) # ordered by trial\nThe trials were conducted at several states in Brazil.\nLet’s see how many trials per state and year.\n    fungicide %>%\n      tabyl(state, year)\n\n    ##  state 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n    ##     BA    3    3    6    8    0    7    0    0    0    0\n    ##     DF    3    0    8    0   10    0    8   16    8    9\n    ##     GO    9   12   24    4   40   42   24   32   40   54\n    ##     MA    3    0    8    0    0    0    0    0    0    0\n    ##     MG    3    3    8    4   10    7    0    0    0    0\n    ##     MS    6    9   36    8   45   20   16    8   24    9\n    ##     MT    3    3    8    0   80   21   32   24   32   45\n    ##     PR   12   14   32   16   30   42   32   24   48   36\n    ##     RS    0    3    0    4   25   35   32    8   16    9\n    ##     SC    0    0    0    0    0    7   16    8    0    0\n    ##     SP   15    9   16    0   25   14    8   16   15   18\n    ##     TO    0    0    8    0    0    0    0    0    0    0\nI want to eliminate states from our analysis with too many gaps in the years and group states by climatic region or geographical proximity.\nI split all six remaining states into three groups as follows.\n    tebu_mix1 <- tebu_mix %>%\n      filter(!state %in% c(\"SC\", \"TO\", \"MA\", \"MG\", \"BA\", \"DF\")) %>%\n      mutate(region = case_when(\n        state %in% c(\"MT\", \"GO\") ~ \"MT+GO\",\n        state %in% c(\"SP\", \"MS\") ~ \"SP+MS\",\n        state %in% c(\"PR\", \"RS\") ~ \"PR+RS\"\n      ))\nNow we need to create our variable of interest, or the percent reduction in disease severity relative to the non-treated check, commonly referred to control efficacy.\nThis can be done by first reshaping data to the wide format using the spread() function.\nThen, with the three response variables in separate columns, we can create the new variable of interest using the mutate() function.\nThe efficacy is obtained from the ratio of fungicide-treated and non-treated subtracted from one.\nHence, the larger the efficacy (zero to 100%), the better is the fungicide.\nNote that selection() was used to preserve only the columns that are relevant.\nAlso note that negative values can be calculated in rare situations where disease severity in the fungicide-treated plot is\nhigher than in the non-treated check of the same experiment.\n    tebu_mix2 <- tebu_mix1 %>%\n      select(trial, year, state, region, active_ingredient, severity) %>%\n      spread(active_ingredient, severity) %>%\n      mutate(\n        tebu_eff = 100 -

    "contents": "\nWe founded OPP in early January this year without too much ambition and zero funding. We envisioned a place to connect more easily with other researchers who, like us, are willing to embrace and promote open science and reproducible practices in plant pathology, mainly focusing on computational aspects of the analysis.\nTo achieve this goal, OPP evolved to:\na core group (leadership) and members who participate in our Slack workspace\nthe OPP website with members’ directory, blog and OPP Notes\na Twitter account\na GitHub organisation.\nWe had no idea how OPP would be received and whether it would catch interest and be sustainable. After the announcement post and a few tweets, we were able to bring together 76 members who signed up to our Slack channels. Of these, 42 members from eight countries (four continents) registered to our member directory. The most represented groups are epidemiologists, modelers, population biologists and programmers, indicated as primary field domain. The traffic in the OPP website was most intense during the first two months (6K page views) with peaks after the first inclusion of original content, an OPP Note, Linear modelling of soil temperature effects on root lesion nematode population densities in R.\nWe were surprised by a quick reaction and initial engagement in our Slack workspace where several channels were created to accommodate smaller groups with a specific interest including #epidemictheory, #phytopathometry, #reproducibility, #teaching and #r-pkg-dev, as among the more active. There have been a lot of interactions and collaborations are on the rise. It is hard to fairly summarize achievements and ideas that have materialized but here are a few selected ones from the channels:\nR package development\nIn #r-pkg-dev channel, we discovered the existence of a the first general plant pathology R package (that any of us were aware of) for conducting epidemiological analysis of spatial disease data, epiphy, developed and maintained by Christophe Gigot. A channel was created for #epiphy for a more focused discussion on package functionalities and suggestions of improvements. To know more about epiphy, check its primer. We brainstormed about other useful packages, and some of us suggested a curated collection of documented data sets from plant pathology articles and other sources to support teaching activities and demonstration of analyses. We recently found a similar idea already implemented, the excellent Agridat package with 263 documented data sets of agricultural experiments accompanied by R scripts (for graphs and analyses) for almost every data set - including some plant disease experiments.\nTeaching approaches\nA preliminary list of “Essential Topics for an Epidemiology Course” has been initially proposed by Neil McRoberts in the #teaching channel and was extended with suggestions by other members. If that will ever materialize into an actual book is unknown, but definitely very good ideas are out there. We would love to see a bookdown botanical epidemiology book!\n\nPeer-reviewed materials\nA peer-reviewed section, following an open peer-review process pioneered by rOpenSci, called OPP Notes was created for the publication of teaching notes, tutorials and reproduction of analysis from previously published work using open source code. It was based on a previous effort to popularize R among plant pathologists about 10 years ago, the series of teaching articles on Ecology and Epidemiology in R by OPP members Paul Esker and Adam Sparks with others. A repository with a template was created for contributors to fork and use with instruction when contributing content. Contributions are reviewed by volunteer OPP members. Our first note, Linear modelling of soil temperature effects on root lesion nematode population densities in R, was written by Adam Sparks and John Thompson and reviewed by Emerson Del Ponte and Mladen Čučak. We hope to have contributions from students as well as more established members of the community with plans for more notes coming this year. The first Note reached more than eight hundred pageviews! Anyone is welcome to contribute Notes or suggestions of other kinds of contents such as documented analysis accompaining original papers, new analysis of published papers, tutorials, etc. The published Notes are archived at Zenodo and assigned a DOI for use when citing them citation.\nFostering collaboration\nOPP is definitely promoting encounters of scientists with mutual interests or complementary skills that are materializing in actual collaborations including planned visits and collaborative research. A question made on the use of a data assimilation technique materialized in a collaborative work between one of our students (Del Ponte Lab) and Dr. Robin Thomas (Oxford). The mutual interest in late blight modeling and the use of R will bring one of us (Adam) to visit Ireland to interact with Mladen and others at the University of Maynooth and TEGASC. Of course it’s not just all about science, we are also thankful to Rene Heim and his wife Ina who volunteered to improve our logo using their talents in graphic design!\nQ&A environment\nThe #general channel is where we expect members posting technical questions of all sorts of plant-pathology related subjects, similar to a discussion mailing list. This has happened but very modestly compared to more general short comments, job announcements, news and discussion of general interest to the group. However, whenever a question is posted, there is always good feedback - see examples below.\n\nReproducible research practices\nIn #reproducibility, there have been interesting discussions and viewpoints shared on the most suitable way of making research project data and code available, also known as a research compendium. Should it be organized as an R package or as an Rstudio project for download and adaptation by the end-user? Is Docker useful when working with packages or research compendiums? The pros and cons have been discussed and defended by diverging views depending on the researcher skills, desired level of automation and objectives.\n\nEither way is more than welcome and these very specific technical discussions have little implication for a field where reproducible research practices, even more simple steps such as data and code sharing, are virtually non-existent according to our recent survey across articles published in plant pathology journals in the last five years (Sparks et al. unpublished). We expect that as journals of the field start to require data and code deposit, these practices gain more interest by the researcher - guidelines of best practices are definitely needed, which were are on our todo list with a focus on particularities of our field.\nWhat is next?\nOur experiences over the past four months have been positive and the feedback and reaction from others has made our experience such. As leaders, we are facing great challenges such as balancing voluntarily maintaining a community like this with our everyday work loads. It is understandable that after the initial boom, the declining or lack of participation by members are due to similar reasons. Anyway, it is being a great learning and the current and potential benefits that may arise from this community, such as those highlighted above, make it worthwhile and we plan to continue our efforts to help make plant pathology more open and accessible!\nInterested in know more and join OPP?

    "contents": "\nSince the early times, plant pathologists faced the need to deal with quantitative data and analysis using mathematics and, more recently, computational tools. The primary leaders in quantitative methods in plant pathology were a relatively small international group of scientists with various backgrounds related to plant pathology.\n\nThis group felt the need to connect and then Plant Disease Epidemiology was formally recognized as a discipline more than 50 years ago. Since then plant epidemiologists/pathologists have met around the world to network, brainstorm and learn from each other to advance the discipline by sharing ideas, experiences, knowledge and philosophical viewpoints.\nThe International Epidemiology Workshop, which occurred eleven times since then, has been central for ensuring the exchange of ideas and information in our field and helps to identify/strengthen new/established links with other fields. The strong connections with mathematics/statistics, genetics and computer science have led to a sort of speciation over the years: computational, theoretical, spatial, molecular, landscape, and digital (big data) epidemiology have popped up in the epidemiology literature.\nThe evolution is natural and such links provide the field with opportunities to bring new expertise and advance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent economically damaging plant disease epidemics and crop losses at various scales. On the other hand, specialization may pose challenges for the identity of a discipline and the scientists need to stay more tightly connected and up to date with the advances on all these fronts. This type of intense specialization can result in a myopic view that may overlook the obvious.\nThe recent and rapid advances in technology have led to new opportunities as well as challenges. In particular, the increasing ability to collect large amounts of data at various scales (from genomes to landscapes). Such scenarios require even more diverse skills from plant pathologists in general to stay alert and connected. The ease with which plant disease-related data (e.g., sequencing and phenotyping) can be obtained and treated with out-of-the-box algorithms by research groups (that lack epidemiologists) can lead to false promises and disastrous consequences for the discipline.\nPlant disease epidemiologists have always been leaders in using quantitative, statistical and computational approaches, which distinguished them from other plant pathologists. Early on, computers have been one of the main tools in the plant epidemiologist’s tool-box - until recently these computer-based tools were specialized and relied on proprietary software.\nA plethora of computer software were developed by leading epidemiologists over the decades and used for research and teaching purposes. However, this software can quickly become deprecated and problems related to technology life-time, portability, compatibility and reproducibility have affected rate of adoption and long-term sustainability.\nDevelopment of new tools for data analysis help to expedite the analysis process. However, increased automation often increases the frequency of incorrect application and/or interpretation, largely because those conducting the analyses often lack access to training by someone who is an expert in these tools and will necessarily rely on vignettes or tutorials shared by others, some of which may not be experts on the subject. It is thus imperative that more sustainable, transparent and reproducible research methods are developed and deployed for the community with the purpose of formal training and research support.\nWe feel that it is more important than ever that scientists acting in the field of plant pathology stay connected and propose that web-based networking tools should be used for effective networking and continued collaboration to promote the field. In light of these issues, we propose to develop a community that values the sharing of knowledge, ideas and data; building capacity; and promotes open and reproducible research to benefit plant epidemiologists. To foster this community, we propose to develop:\nA community-maintained website to promote this workgroup: people, projects and blog posts (new articles, tutorials, view-points, etc.).\nAn open chatting workspace using Slack to enable effective, year-round communication and collaborative work via specific channels, i.e., a Slack workspace open to any interested party (https://openplantpathology.slack.com).\nMore broadly, a community that stimulates and supports efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and reproducible research tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications (teaching or research) using open source software (e.g., R, Python), open data (e.g., Dryad, Figshare, OSF, Genbank, etc.), and open software repositories (e.g., GitHub).\nWe welcome your participation in this community and hope that you will join us! To join the Slack workgroup, please send a request to openplantpathology@gmail.com.\nOur repositories are available at https://www.github.com/openplantpathology, to request to join them please send a message to Adam Sparks (adam.sparks@usq.edu.au) or Emerson Del Ponte (delponte@ufv.br) after you have joined the Slack workgroup.\n\n\nCommunity Founders\n\nEmerson M.
