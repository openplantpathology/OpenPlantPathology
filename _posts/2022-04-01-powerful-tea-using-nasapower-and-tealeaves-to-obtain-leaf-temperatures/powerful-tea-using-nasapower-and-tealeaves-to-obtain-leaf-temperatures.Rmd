## Introduction

The incidence and severity of plant diseases are dependant on environmental effects which is emphasised by the [disease triangle](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/foreducators/TeachingNotes/Pages/DiseaseTriangle.aspx) [@Francl_2001].
Arguably the effect of temperature on disease can be the most important of environmental influences.
One problem with evaluating the effect of temperatures on disease incidence and severity is the difference between air temperatures measured at a weather station and the micro-environment of the plant canopy.

When modelling plant disease outbreaks, being able to accurately estimate the conditions which lead to localised plant disease epidemics can be very useful.
This led me to the R package [_tealeaves_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tealeaves) [@Muir2019], which provides functions for calculating leaf temperatures from ambient environmental inputs.

If you have not already, install the packages _tealeaves_ and _nasapower_ with `install.packages(c("tealeaves", "nasapower"))`.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("nasapower")
library("tealeaves")
```

```{r load_library}
library(tealeaves)
```

Before I begin, it is worth noting _tealeaves_ uses the package, [_units_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/units.html), to format the inputs and outputs [@Pebesma_etal2016].
Detail about the package _tealeaves_ and it's functions can be found in Muir's publication [@Muir2020], and in the vignettes which can be obtained by running the following commands in R:

  - `vignette("tealeaves-introduction")`,
  - `vignette("tealeaves-intermediate")`  

For brevity, I will not go in depth into _tealeaves_ but provide a simple example using default parameters, then how to change default environmental parameters with ones obtained from the _nasapower_ package.

### First, a brief _tealeaves_ example

```{r simple_example}
lf_par <- make_leafpar()
env_par <- make_enviropar()
const <- make_constants()

Tm_leaf <-
  tleaf(leaf_par = lf_par,
        enviro_par = env_par,
        constants = const)

Tm_leaf[, c("T_leaf", "E")]
```


The function `tleaf()` calculates leaf temperature and evapotranspiration by solving an energy budget equation from incoming solar radiation, air temperatures, reflectance, and heat loss to wind and evapotranspiration for a leaf with certain characteristics [@Muir2019]. 
This equation requires these parameter inputs which describe this energy budget for calculating leaf temperature.
The parameters are created or altered through the package functions:

  - `make_leafpar()` defines the leaf parameters and characteristics,
  - `make_enviropar()` sets environmental parameters,
  - `make_constants()` defines the constants used in the `tleaf()` equation.  

The `tleaf()` function returns an output containing details of the thermal energy absorbed and emitted, including an estimate of evapotranspiration (`"E"`), which assists in defining the estimated leaf temperature (`"T_leaf"`), given in Kelvin.

We can replace the default environmental parameters with values parsed from a weather station or remote sensing satellite data retrieved by using the R package _nasapower_ [@Sparks2018; @Sparks2022].

## _nasapower_ <img src="POWERlogo.png" align="right" /> 

Let's download some hourly data using the _nasapower_ [@Sparks2018; @Sparks2022] package.
More information on using the _nasapower_ package can be found by calling the vignette `vignette(nasapower)`.

```{r get_power}
library(nasapower)
np <- get_power(
  community = "ag",
  pars = c(
    "RH2M", # Relative humidity at 2 meters
    "T2M", # Air temperature at 2 meters
    "WS2M", # wind speed at 2 meters
    "ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN", # short wave downward solar radiation at the earth surface
    "ALLSKY_SFC_LW_DWN", # long wave downward solar radiation at the earth surface
    "PS", # surface pressure
    "ALLSKY_SRF_ALB" # Surface albedo
  ),
  temporal_api = "hourly",
  lonlat = c(150.88, -26.83),
  dates = c("2021-02-01", "2021-02-08")
)
```

In the `get_power()` function above, I have requested data from the [NASA "POWER" project](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) from the agricultural weather data collection (`"ag"`).
These data contain all the energy balance inputs needed from a 0.5Â° grid cell at the specified latitude and longitude (`latlong`).
The coordinates I have used are just north of Dalby in Queensland, Australia.
Additionally, I have requested hourly data for the first week in February 2021 with the `"temporal_api"` argument.

```{r print_data}
np
```

## Estimate leaf temperatures

Next, I will characterise the environmental parameters using the `np` data at a single time point into the `tleaf()`.

```{r make_new_par}
env_par <- make_enviropar(
  replace = list(
    P = set_units(np$PS[1], "kPa"),             # Air pressure
    r = set_units(np$ALLSKY_SRF_ALB[1]),        # Albedo 
    RH = set_units(np$RH2M[1]/100),             # Relative Humidity (as a proportion)
    S_sw = set_units(np$ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN[1],
                     "W/m^2"),                  # Short wave radiation
    T_air = set_units(
      set_units(np$T2M[1], "DegC"),
      "K"),                                     # Air temperature, converted from Celsius to Kelvin
    wind = set_units(np$WS2M[1], "m/s")         # Wind speed
    )
)
```

Now I can run the `tleaf()` function again with the updated environmental parameters.

```{r leaf_data}
Tm_leaf <-
  tleaf(leaf_par = lf_par,
        enviro_par = env_par,
        constants = const)

Tm_leaf[, c("T_leaf", "E")]
```

Because the outputs are specified using the _units_ package I can easily convert from Kelvin back to degrees Celsius using the `set_units()` function again.

```{r leaf_temp}
set_units(Tm_leaf$T_leaf, "DegC")
```

## Leaf temperature gradients

Imputing vectors as parameters returns leaf temperature gradients across the supplied parameter permutations and not a vector of times.
Below is an example of the permutations `t_leaves()` processes from a vector of environmental parameters.
This is described further in the _tealeaves_ vignette.

```{r leaf_grad}
env_par <- make_enviropar(
  replace = list(
    P = set_units(np$PS[1:2], "kPa"),
    r = set_units(np$ALLSKY_SRF_ALB[1:2]),
    RH = set_units(np$RH2M[1:2] / 100), # needs to be specified as a proportion
    S_sw = set_units(np$ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN[1:2], "W/m^2"),
    T_air = set_units(set_units(np$T2M[1:2], "DegC"),
                      "K"),             # convert from degrees to Kelvin
    wind = set_units(np$WS2M[1:2], "m/s")
  )
)

Tm_leaves <-
  tleaves(leaf_par = lf_par,
          enviro_par = env_par,
          constants = const)

dim(Tm_leaves)
head(Tm_leaves[, c("T_leaf", "E")])
```

We can see that the `tleaves()` function uses the multiple values specified in the environmental parameters to calculate all possible gradients.
As such 64 values are returned ($2^6$), permutations of the input environmental parameters.

_However in this example we want leaf temperature estimates over time, not space._

## Leaf temperature time-series

To obtain a time series I can use the `apply()` function to pass the environmental parameters to `tleaf()` one time point at a time.

First, I need to clean up the data a little by substituting `NA` albedo values generated by night-time measurements.
Here I have substituted it with the mean.

```{r sub_na}
np$ALLSKY_SRF_ALB[is.na(np$ALLSKY_SRF_ALB)] <-
  mean(np$ALLSKY_SRF_ALB, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r apply_tleaf}
tm_leaf_list <-
  apply(np, 1, function(nasa_p) {
    env_par <- make_enviropar(
      replace = list(
        P = set_units(nasa_p["PS"], "kPa"),
        r = set_units(nasa_p["ALLSKY_SRF_ALB"]),
        RH = set_units(nasa_p["RH2M"] / 100), # needs to be specified as a proportion
        S_sw = set_units(nasa_p["ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN"], "W/m^2"),
        T_air = set_units(set_units(nasa_p["T2M"], "DegC"),
                          "K"),               # convert from degrees to Kelvin
        wind = set_units(nasa_p["WS2M"], "m/s")
      )
    )
    
    return(tleaf(
      leaf_par = lf_par,
      enviro_par = env_par,
      constants = const,
      quiet = TRUE
    ))
    
  })

# bind the list into a data.frame
Leaf_temperatures <-
  do.call("rbind", c(tm_leaf_list, make.row.names = FALSE))

Leaf_temperatures[1:10, c("T_leaf", "E")]
```

I can now pair up the time and air temperature data from the NASA power data with the leaf temperature data.
Also, I will convert temperature in Kelvin to degrees Celsius.

```{r tidy_tleaf}
Leaf_temperatures$air_temp <-
  np$T2M

Leaf_temperatures$times <-
  as.POSIXct(paste0(np$YEAR, "-",
                    np$MO, "-",
                    np$DY, " ",
                    np$HR, ":00:00"),
             tz = "Australia/Brisbane")
Leaf_temperatures$T_leaf <-
  set_units(Leaf_temperatures$T_leaf, "DegC")
```

## Plotting leaf temperature

Finally, I can visualise the change in air temperature and leaf temperatures over time.

```{r plot_tleaf}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Leaf_temperatures,
       aes(x = times)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = air_temp, colour = "darkblue"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = drop_units(T_leaf),
                colour = "forestgreen"), size = 1) +
  labs(y = "Temperature (Degrees Celcius)",
       color = "Estimates") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("darkblue", "forestgreen"),
    labels = c("Air Tm",
               "Leaf Tm")
  )
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this will help get you started for using these two packages to estimate leaf
and canopy temperatures.
However, further parameterisation would be necessary prior to any in-depth analyses.
Leaf parameters, such as leaf size, reflectance, absorbance, stomatal conductance and ratio should be carefully considered in addition to vertical environmental gradients across the height of the plant.
Shading in the canopy is known to effect pathogen infection, colonisation and sporulation in addition to leaf wetness.
