## Biography

Buddhika Amarasinghe Dahanayaka is a third year PhD student in the Centre for Crop Health at the University of Southern Queensland.
Her PhD research is based on genetic characterisation and identification of virulence genes of a barley fungal pathogen, *Pyrenophora teres*.
She completed her Master of Philosophy at Wayamba University of Sri Lanka on identifying genes responsible for salinity tolerance in rice and her research interests include QTL mapping, population genetics, phylogenetics and bioinformatics.
Her recent publications based on her PhD project, "[Population structure of *Pyrenophora teres* f. *teres* barley pathogens from different continents](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-09-20-0390-R?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)" and "[Investigating in vitro mating preference between or within the two forms of *Pyrenophora teres* and its hybrids](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-02-21-0058-R)", are available at *Phytopathology* (*Firstlook*).

## Abstract

Characterization of *Pyrenophora teres* isolates and mapping of virulence genes *Pyrenophora teres* is the causative agent of net blotch of barley and one of the most economically important fungal pathogens affecting the Australian barley industry.
My PhD study addressed some of the research gaps involving the *P. teres*-barley pathosystem: 1) *Pyrenophora teres* f.
*teres* (*Ptt*) populations collected from different continents were genetically characterised and revealed recent/ongoing gene migration among/within different continents.
Two field hybrids were also identified.
2) The mating preference between the two forms of *P. teres* and its hybrids were investigated by crossing different sets of *Ptt* and *Pyrenophora teres* f.
*maculata* (*Ptm*) isolates.
This indicated that *Ptm* did not have a mating preference for the same form but mostly hybridised with *Ptt* isolates.
*Ptt* isolates had greater reproduction vigour than *Ptm* isolates under the given laboratory conditions.
3) Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of a *Ptt*/*Ptm* cross detected nine QTL associated with virulence and leaf symptoms on five different linkage groups/chromosomes.
