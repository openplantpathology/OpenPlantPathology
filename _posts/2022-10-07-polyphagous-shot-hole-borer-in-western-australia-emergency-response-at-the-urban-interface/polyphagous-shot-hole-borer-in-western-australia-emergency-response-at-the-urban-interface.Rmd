title: "Polyphagous shot-hole borer in Western Australia â€“ emergency response at the urban interface"
description: |
  Polyphagous shot-hole borer (PSHB; Euwallacea fornicatus) was detected in August 2021 by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) in the Perth metropolitan area of Western Australia (WA). PSHB is an agricultural and environmental pest, with a wide host range (>400 amenity, fruit and nut tree species). This presentation will summarise PSHB biology and DPIRD response activities and explore some of the challenges and opportunities present at the urban forest- residential interface. Kylie will also speak to what it is like to work as a subject matter expert during a plant pest incursion.

## Abstract

Polyphagous shot-hole borer (PSHB; _Euwallacea fornicatus_) was detected in August 2021 by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) in the Perth metropolitan area of Western Australia (WA).
PSHB is an agricultural and environmental pest, with a wide host range (more than 400 amenity, fruit and nut tree species).
The beetle bores into living mature trees and can cause limb dieback and tree death.
PSHB lives in close association with a symbiotic fungus, an ambrosia clade _Fusarium_ species (_Fusarium sp_. [AF-18] in WA), that it farms as a food source.
A Quarantine Area has been established to prevent spread of the pest and DPIRD is actively managing infested trees.
The response has impacted residents, local governments, green-waste operators and numerous plant and wood-based industries.
This presentation will summarise PSHB biology and DPIRD response activities and explore some of the challenges and opportunities present at the urban forest- residential interface.
Kylie will also speak to what it is like to work as a subject matter expert during a plant pest incursion.
