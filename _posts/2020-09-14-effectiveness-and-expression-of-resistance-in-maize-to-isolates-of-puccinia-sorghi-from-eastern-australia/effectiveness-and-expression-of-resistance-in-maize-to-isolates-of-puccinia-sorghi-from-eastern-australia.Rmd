  Open Plant Pathology Virtual seminar given by Ms. Aurelie Quade from the University of Southern Queensland. The vulnerability of the Australian maize industry to Puccina sorghi is currently unknown. Maize is grown across a range of agro-ecological regions in Australia and the effectiveness and stability of deployed Rp genes has not been examined.

### Abstract

The vulnerability of the Australian maize industry to _Puccina sorghi_ is currently unknown.
Maize is grown across a range of agro-ecological regions in Australia and the effectiveness and stability of deployed Rp genes has not been examined.
Further to this, assessments of the _P. sorghi_ population to determine pathotype diversity have not been conducted for many years.
The current study was undertaken to assess phenotypic, genetic and physiological resistance to common rust and provide support for maize breeding programs in Australia.
