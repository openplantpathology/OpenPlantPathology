      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We founded OPP in early January this year without too much ambition and zero funding. We envisioned a place to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openplantpathology.org/post/2018-01-08-first-post-community-call/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;connect more easily with other  researchers&lt;/a&gt; who, like us, are willing to embrace and promote open science and reproducible practices in plant pathology, mainly focusing on computational aspects of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this goal, OPP evolved to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a core group (leadership) and members who participate in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://openplantpathology.slack.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slack workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the OPP website with members&amp;rsquo; directory, blog and OPP Notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/openplantpath&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openplantpathology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub organisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no idea how OPP would be received and whether it would catch interest and be sustainable. After the announcement post and a few tweets, we were able to bring together 76 members who signed up to our Slack channels. Of these, 42 members from eight countries (four continents) registered to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openplantpathology.org/directory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;member directory&lt;/a&gt;. The most represented groups are epidemiologists, modelers, population biologists and programmers, indicated as primary field domain. The traffic in the OPP website was most intense during the first two months (6K page views) with peaks after the first inclusion of original content, an OPP Note, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openplantpathology.org/notes/sparks/1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linear modelling of soil temperature effects on root lesion nematode population densities in R&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were surprised by a quick reaction and initial engagement in our Slack workspace where several channels were created to accommodate smaller groups with a specific interest including #epidemictheory, #phytopathometry, #reproducibility, #teaching and #r-pkg-dev, as among the more active. There have been a lot of interactions and collaborations are on the rise. It is hard to fairly summarize achievements and ideas that have materialized but here are a few selected ones from the channels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;r-package-development&#34;&gt;R package development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #r-pkg-dev channel, we discovered the existence of a the first general plant pathology R package (that any of us were aware of) for conducting epidemiological analysis of spatial disease data, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chgigot/epiphy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;epiphy&lt;/a&gt;, developed and maintained by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christophe_Gigot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Christophe Gigot&lt;/a&gt;. A channel was created for #epiphy for a more focused discussion on package functionalities and suggestions of improvements. To know more about &lt;em&gt;epiphy&lt;/em&gt;, check its &lt;a href=&#34;https://chgigot.github.io/epiphy/articles/epiphy.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt;. We brainstormed about other useful packages, and some of us suggested a curated collection of documented data sets from plant pathology articles and other sources to support teaching activities and demonstration of analyses. We recently found a similar idea already implemented, the excelent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kwstat/agridat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Agridat&lt;/a&gt; package with 263 documented data sets of agricultural experiments accompanied by R scripts (for graphs and analyses) for almost every data set - including some plant disease experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;teaching-approaches&#34;&gt;Teaching approaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A preliminary list of &amp;ldquo;Essential Topics for an Epidemiology Course&amp;rdquo; has been initially proposed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Neil McRoberts&lt;/a&gt; in the #teaching channel and was extended with suggestions by other members. If that will ever materialize into an actual book is unknown, but definitely very good ideas are out there. We would love to see a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bookdown&lt;/a&gt; botanical epidemiology book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/posts/post2-fig1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;peer-reviewed-materials&#34;&gt;Peer-reviewed materials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed section, following an open peer-review process pioneered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openplantpathology.org/publication/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPP Notes&lt;/a&gt; was created for the publication of teaching notes, tutorials and reproduction of analysis from previously published work using open source code. It was based on a previous effort to popularize R among plant pathologists about 10 years ago, the series of teaching articles on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/advanced/topics/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/Pages/default.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ecology and Epidemiology in R&lt;/a&gt; by OPP members Paul Esker and Adam Sparks with others. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openplantpathology/contributions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;repository with a template&lt;/a&gt; was created for contributors to fork and use with instruction when contributing content. Contributions are reviewed by volunteer OPP members. Our first note, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openplantpathology.org/notes/sparks/1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linear modelling of soil temperature effects on root lesion nematode population densities in R&lt;/a&gt;, was written by Adam Sparks and John Thompson and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openplantpathology/contributions/issues/1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Emerson Del Ponte and Mladen Čučak. We hope to have contributions from students as well as more established members of the community with plans for more notes coming this  year. The first Note reached more than eight hundred pageviews! Anyone is welcome to contribute Notes or suggestions of other kinds of contents such as documented analysis accompaining original papers, new analysis of published papers, tutorials, etc. The published Notes are archived at &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/1173391#.WwGsaFMvzu4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zenodo and assigned a DOI for use when citing them citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fostering-collaboration&#34;&gt;Fostering collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPP is definitely promoting encounters of scientists with mutual interests or complementary skills that are materializing in actual collaborations including planned visits and collaborative research. A question made on the use of a data assimilation technique materialized in a collaborative work between one of our students (Del Ponte Lab) and Dr. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/staff/dr-robin-thompson&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robin Thomas&lt;/a&gt; (Oxford). The mutual interest in late blight modeling and the use of R will bring one of us (Adam) to visit Ireland to interact with Mladen and others at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of Maynooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teagasc.ie/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TEGASC&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s not just all about science, we are also thankful to Rene Heim and his wife Ina who volunteered to improve our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openplantpathology/OpenPlantPathology/blob/master/public/img/OPP-hex.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; using their talents in graphic design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;q-a-environment&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #general channel is where we expect members posting technical questions of all sorts of plant-pathology related subjects, similar to a discussion mailing list. This has happened but very modestly compared to more general short comments, job announcements, news and discussion of general interest to the group. However, whenever a question is posted, there is always good feedback - see examples below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/posts/post2-fig2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducible-research-practices&#34;&gt;Reproducible research practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #reproducibility, there have been interesting discussions and viewpoints shared on the most suitable way of making research project data and code available, also known as a research compendium. Should it be organized as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openplantpathology/rice_awd_pests&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R package&lt;/a&gt; or as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emdelponte/research-compendium-website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rstudio project&lt;/a&gt; for download and adaptation by the end-user? Is Docker useful when working with packages or research compendiums? The pros and cons have been discussed and defended by diverging views depending on the researcher skills, desired level of automation and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/posts/post2-fig3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way is more than welcome and these very specific technical discussions have little implication for a field where reproducible research practices, even more simple steps such as data and code sharing, are virtually non-existent according to our recent survey across articles published in plant pathology journals in the last five years (Sparks et al. unpublished). We expect that as journals of the field start to require data and code deposit, these practices gain more interest by the researcher - guidelines of best practices are definitely needed, which were are on our todo list with a focus on particularities of our field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-next&#34;&gt;What is next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experiences over the past four months have been positive and the feedback and reaction from others has made our experience such. As leaders, we are facing great challenges such as balancing voluntarily maintaining a community like this with our everyday work loads. It is understandable that after the initial boom, the declining or lack of participation by members are due to similar reasons. Anyway, it is being a great learning and the current and potential benefits that may arise from this community, such as those highlighted above, make it worthwhile and we plan to continue our efforts to help make plant pathology more open and accessible!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are you a scientist dealing with computational plant pathology? Then let&#39;s connect and code together!</title>
      <link>/post/2018-01-08-first-post-community-call/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2018-01-08-first-post-community-call/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the early times, plant pathologists faced the need to deal with quantitative data and analysis using mathematics and, more recently, computational tools. The primary leaders in quantitative methods in plant pathology were a relatively small international group of scientists with various backgrounds related to plant pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group felt the need to connect and then Plant Disease Epidemiology was formally recognized as a discipline more than 50 years ago. Since then plant epidemiologists/pathologists have met around the world to network, brainstorm and learn from each other to advance  the discipline by sharing ideas, experiences, knowledge and philosophical viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Epidemiology Workshop, which occurred eleven times since then, has been central for ensuring the exchange of ideas and information in our field and helps to identify/strengthen new/established links with other fields. The strong connections with mathematics/statistics, genetics and computer science have led to a sort of speciation over the years: computational, theoretical, spatial, molecular, landscape, and digital (big data) epidemiology have popped up in the epidemiology literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution is natural and such links provide the field with opportunities to bring new expertise and advance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent economically damaging plant disease epidemics and crop losses at various scales. On the other hand, specialization may pose challenges for the identity of a discipline and the scientists need to stay more tightly connected and up to date with the advances on all these fronts. This type of intense specialization can result in a myopic view that may overlook the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent and rapid  advances in technology have led to new opportunities as well as challenges. In particular, the increasing ability to collect large amounts of data at various scales (from genomes to landscapes). Such scenarios require even more diverse skills from plant pathologists in general to stay alert and connected. The ease with which plant disease-related data (e.g., sequencing and phenotyping) can be obtained and treated with out-of-the-box algorithms by research groups (that lack epidemiologists) can lead to false promises and disastrous consequences for the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant disease epidemiologists have always been leaders in using quantitative, statistical and computational approaches, which distinguished them from other plant pathologists. Early on, computers have been one of the main tools in the plant epidemiologist&amp;rsquo;s tool-box - until recently these computer-based tools were specialized and relied on proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plethora of computer software were developed by leading epidemiologists over the decades and used for research and teaching purposes. However, this software can quickly become deprecated and problems related to technology life-time, portability, compatibility and reproducibility have affected rate of adoption and long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of new tools for data analysis help to expedite the analysis process. However, increased automation often increases the frequency of incorrect application and/or interpretation, largely because those conducting the analyses often lack access to training by someone who is an expert in these tools and will necessarily rely on vignettes or tutorials shared by others, some of which may not be experts on the subject. It is thus imperative that more sustainable, transparent and reproducible research methods are developed and deployed for the community with the purpose of formal training and research support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel that it is more important than ever that scientists acting in the field of plant pathology stay connected and propose that web-based networking tools should be used for effective networking and continued collaboration to promote the field. In light of these issues, we propose to develop a community that values the sharing of knowledge, ideas and data; building capacity; and promotes open and reproducible research to benefit plant epidemiologists. To foster this community, we propose to develop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A community-maintained website to promote this workgroup: people, projects and blog posts (new articles, tutorials, view-points, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open chatting workspace using Slack to enable effective, year-round communication and collaborative work via specific channels, i.e., a Slack workspace open to any interested party (&lt;a href=&#34;https://openplantpathology.slack.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://openplantpathology.slack.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, a community that stimulates and supports efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and reproducible research tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications (teaching or research) using open source software (e.g., R, Python), open data (e.g., Dryad, Figshare, OSF, Genbank, etc.), and open software repositories (e.g., GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome your participation in this community and hope that you will join us! To join the Slack workgroup, please send a request to openplantpathology@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our repositories are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.github.com/openplantpathology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.github.com/openplantpathology&lt;/a&gt;, to request to join them please send a message to Adam Sparks (adam.sparks@usq.edu.au) or Emerson Del Ponte (delponte@ufv.br) after you have joined the Slack workgroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pratylenchus thornei&lt;/em&gt;, the root-lesion nematode, is widely distributed in wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt;) growing areas of many countries and is of particular concern in sub-tropical environments &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Thompson 2015)&lt;/span&gt;. These nematodes penetrate roots to feed and reproduce in the root cortex leading to loss of root function, which affects nutrient and water uptake of nutrients and water causing nutrient deficiency and water stress &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Thompson 2015)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original paper the population response of &lt;em&gt;P. thornei&lt;/em&gt; in Queensland, Australia wheat to temperature is modelled using a linear and quadratic equations. The study aimed to investigate the effects of soil profile temperatures after different sowing dates on reproduction of the nematodes in susceptible and moderately resistant wheat cultivars in the subtropical grain region of eastern Australia. This document recreates the models for population densities of &lt;em&gt;P. thornei&lt;/em&gt; as described in the original paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;objectives&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of models described in the paper, the first model is a linear model used to describe the unplanted control and two quadratic models fit Gatcher (Susceptible) and GS50a (Moderately Resistant) wheat cultivars. For a more detailed discussion on fitting plant disease models in R, please see the “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/advanced/topics/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/DiseaseProgress/Pages/LinearRegression.aspx&#34;&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/a&gt;” module in the “Ecology and Epidemiology in R” documents available in the American Phytopathological Society’s (APS) Education Center. For an even more in-depth discussion on linear models in R, how to fit and how to interpret the diagnostics that R provides the reader should refer to Faraway &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2002)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will illustrate how to fit the original linear and quadratic models using the original data in R &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(R Core Team 2017)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Packages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2017)&lt;/span&gt; package simplifies the libraries used in this work. It is a collection of packages designed to work together for data science, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.tidyverse.org/&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; includes, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2017)&lt;/span&gt;, used to import the data; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2018)&lt;/span&gt;, used to format the data; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2017)&lt;/span&gt;, used to subset the data; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2016)&lt;/span&gt;, used for visualising the data and model fits. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;viridis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2018)&lt;/span&gt; is a selection of colour pallets that are widely accessible for people with colour-blindness and printing in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code chunk checks first to see if you have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;viridis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; installed, if not, it will automatically install them and then load them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wide to Long Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that each of the varieties have their own column in the original data format, this is commonly called wide data. Wide data are commonly found in spreadsheets but do not lend themselves easily to data analysis, modelling and visualisation. To make it easier to do these things it is common to convert the data from wide to long format, commonly referred to as tidying, when using R. The advantage of a tidy dataset is that it is easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and always has a specific structure where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Wickham 2014)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for visualising the data, they need to be converted from wide to long. Using &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package to convert from wide to long format where the varieties are all listed in a single column, &lt;code&gt;Variety&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see, the original &lt;code&gt;nema&lt;/code&gt; data had only 24 rows and the long format of the data have 120 rows now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;unplanted-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unplanted Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a linear model for the unplanted control. Here we will write a function to use in modelling the unplanted population data. I have wrapped the model in a function which makes it pipe-able, &lt;code&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code&gt; and has other advantages when it comes to fitting the same model to several sets of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the linear equation for the Unplanted control treatment, the rate of population increase can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[y = y_0 + rt\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is the initial population, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is the rate of change and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; equal time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fitting-a-linear-model&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fitting a Linear Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;linear_model &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cf&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(df) {
  &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;lm&lt;/span&gt;(
    Log_pop &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Degree_days,
    &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;data =&lt;/span&gt; df
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now check the model fit, using &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to select only Unplanted data from the data set for the model and fit the linear model to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;unplanted_model &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nema_long &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(Variety &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt; &amp;quot;Unplanted&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;linear_model&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;par(mfrow = c(2, 2))&lt;/code&gt; creates a four-panel graph rather than four individual graphs, which the next function will create by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function with any &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt; object will create four diagnostic plots for your inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;par&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;mfrow =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;(unplanted_model)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/notes/sparks/1/index_files/figure-html/plot_model-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These plots do not appear to indicate anything amiss as one would hope for from the models that have already been published. If you are unfamiliar with how to interpret these diagnostic plots see &lt;a href=&#34;#interpreting-linear-models-in-r&#34;&gt;Interpreting Linear Models in R&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;#further-reading&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; function displays information about the model fit. If you are unfamiliar with how to read and interpret the output of &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; for a linear model, please refer to &lt;a href=&#34;#interpreting-linear-models-in-r&#34;&gt;Interpreting Linear Models in R&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;#further-reading&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/a&gt; section for references that go into more detail on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion and Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the original paper, the model equations can be derived from these models as well. The derived regression equations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatcher (Susceptible): &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ln(P. thornei + 1) = -0.000003(0.0000009)T^2 + 0.009(0.0019)T + 5.4671(0.904)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GS50a (Moderately Resistant): &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ln(P. thornei + 1) = -0.000002(0.0000007)T^2 + 0.0063(0.0014)T + 5.1559(0.678)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanted Control: &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ln(P. thornei + 1) = 0.0013(0.00018)T + 5.4151(0.193)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer back to the &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; outputs for each of the models for the coefficient values and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(R^2\)&lt;/span&gt; values, which match those reported in the original paper where the models were fit with Genstat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatcher and GS50a have similar phenologies, but differ in resistance to root lesion nematodes, making the model comparisons a reasonable objective. The original paper goes on to test the effect of sowing date based on degree days. &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Thompson 2015)&lt;/span&gt; reported a 61% increase in yield on average from sowing the susceptible, intolerant cultivar Gatcher at the end of May than sowing it in the third week of June. By June the soil temperatures and nematode populations were both greater, leading to lower wheat yield. The effects were less pronounced in the moderately resistant cultivar, GS50a, but were similar with a reduction in nematode population densities occurring due to earlier planting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The models illustrated here for Gatcher and GS50a were able to accurately reflect the changes in nematode population as a result of degree days, which affected the nematodes’ ability to damage the crop and reduce yield &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Thompson 2015)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exploring Why the Data Were Log Transformed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper the the natural log, &lt;code&gt;ln() +1&lt;/code&gt;, of the nematode population counts were used to fit the models. Here we will explore a bit further why this was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A note about using &lt;code&gt;log() + 1&lt;/code&gt; rather than just &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;. This is necessary with these data to avoid taking &lt;code&gt;log(0)&lt;/code&gt;. Try it in R to see what happens if you are not familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, plot the data for each of the four temperatures and the four varieties, plus the unplanted control converting from the natural log value back to the original actual count values to see what the population numbers look like. Note the use of &lt;code&gt;exp() - 1&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic, to transform the values from the &lt;code&gt;ln() + 1&lt;/code&gt; values. Doing this shows us the original data’s values and helps demonstrate why the data were log transformed for analysis. To examine the data, first we will use boxplots and then quantile-quantile (qq) plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boxplots show that there is a wide range of values with the 25 ˚C temperature populations close to zero with others having quite large ranges, this could indicate heteroscedasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, looking at the qq-plots it is apparent that the original data do not meet the assumptions of normally distributed errors for a linear model. See the &lt;a href=&#34;#further-reading&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/a&gt; section for suggested reading on interpreting qq-plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see that the &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt; transformed data’s boxplots show fewer outliers and tighter range of values. The qq-plots also indicate that it is possible to conduct a linear regression with these data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using AIC to Compare Model Quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the original paper used a linear model for the unplanted data, a polynomial model also fits these data quite well. We can compare the original linear model from the paper with a polynomial model quite easily in R to see how the models compare using AIC (Akaike information criterion). AIC is used to measure the models’ relative quality to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;unplanted_model&lt;/code&gt; object already exists as a product of the linear model, we simply need to use the polynomial model with the unplanted data to create a new object to compare them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;unplanted_poly_model &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nema_long &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;

To get a better feel for how these models compare, AIC can be used to determine the relative quality of a model for a &lt;em&gt;given set of data&lt;/em&gt;. That is, you cannot compare models for other data using AIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the AIC is quite simple in R, just &lt;code&gt;AIC()&lt;/code&gt;. Here we check the AIC of the original linear &lt;code&gt;unplanted_model&lt;/code&gt; and the new &lt;code&gt;unplanted_poly_model&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;AIC&lt;/span&gt;(unplanted_model)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 26.17149&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;AIC&lt;/span&gt;(unplanted_poly_model)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 27.05797&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally when fitting models, you look for the least complex model that provides the best explanation of the variation in the data. In this case the original linear model has a lower AIC, 26.1714857, than that of the polynomial model, 27.0579669, but they are extremely close and the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(R^2\)&lt;/span&gt; value of the polynomial model, 0.7101253, is a bit better than the linear model’s &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(R^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, 0.6963592, as well. Therefore, without more data to distinguish the models it appears that either model suffices for the data provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tidy Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wickham &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2014)&lt;/span&gt; introduced the idea of tidy data for analysis. As you work with raw data from many sources, it is useful to understand what this means and why it is useful. In this example, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was used to convert the data from wide to long format. For a more in-depth look at using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interpreting Linear Models in R&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Georgia has a nice, easy to understand set of materials that demonstrate how to interpret diagnostic plot outputs from &lt;code&gt;plot(lm.object)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://strata.uga.edu/8370/rtips/regressionPlots.html&#34;&gt;Regression diagnostic plots&lt;/a&gt; on their Data Analysis in the Geosciences page. For even more, this Cross Validated question has an excellent discussion on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/58141/interpreting-plot-lm&#34;&gt;Interpreting plot.lm()&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Montana provides an on-line text, “&lt;em&gt;Statistics With R&lt;/em&gt;”, that includes a section on &lt;a href=&#34;https://arc.lib.montana.edu/book/statistics-with-r-textbook/item/57&#34;&gt;ANOVA model diagnostics including QQ-plots&lt;/a&gt;. Since ANOVA uses &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt; in R, the tools and descriptions here are applicable to the qq-plots we have generated here in this illustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a detailed look at how to interpret the output from &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; for linear models, see The YHAT Blog post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.yhat.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html&#34;&gt;Fitting &amp;amp; Interpreting Linear Models in R&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faraway &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(2002)&lt;/span&gt;, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Faraway-PRA.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practical Regression and Anova using R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” is an excellent free resource that goes into detail about fitting linear models using R and how to interpret the diagnostics. Prof. Faraway has more recent books on the subject as well that you might wish to borrow from your library or purchase, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/LMR/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/LMR/&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selecting the Right Colour Scheme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting good colour schemes is essential for communicating your message. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;viridis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package makes this much easier to do. Bob Rudis has a nice blog post when the package was first introduced that demonstrates why it is useful to use a package like this for your colour palettes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rud.is/b/2015/07/20/using-the-new-viridis-colormap-in-r-thanks-to-simon-garnier/&#34;&gt;Using the new ‘viridis’ colormap in R (thanks to Simon Garnier)&lt;/a&gt;. Other colour palettes for R exist as well. Notably the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;RColorBrewer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package provides an easy-to-use interface for the fantastic Colour Brewer palettes &lt;a href=&#34;http://colorbrewer2.org/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://colorbrewer2.org/&lt;/a&gt; commonly used for cartography but also useful for graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
